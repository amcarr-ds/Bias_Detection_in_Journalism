Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issued her first solo dissent in a Supreme Court merits case Thursday, disagreeing with her colleagues in a labor dispute ruling that makes it easier for companies to sue over worker strikes.
In an 8-1 decision, the high court overturned a lower ruling that found federal union laws preempted concrete company Glacier Northwest from bringing its lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents the company’s truck drivers.


  

Jackson wrote that the courts had “no business delving into this particular labor dispute at this time.”
“[T]he majority also misapplies the Board’s cases in a manner that threatens to impede both the Board’s uniform development of labor law and erode the right to strike,” Jackson dissented.
The case arose after the union directed its drivers to go on strike on a morning the company was mixing concrete, loading it onto trucks and making deliveries. The concrete mixed that day was ruined, and Glacier sued the union for damages in state court.
Under a 1959 Supreme Court precedent, San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), a federal law that governs strikes and collective bargaining, preempts state law when the two arguably conflict.
After the union got the lawsuit tossed at the Washington Supreme Court under Garmon, Glacier Northwest appealed to the nation’s highest court.
In a majority opinion authored by conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett and joined by four of her colleagues, the court ruled that the NLRA did not preempt the lawsuit, because the strike did not take reasonable precautions to protect the company’s property from foreseeable, imminent danger.


  

“The Union’s actions not only resulted in the destruction of all the concrete Glacier had prepared that day; they also posed a risk of foreseeable, aggravated, and imminent harm to Glacier’s trucks. Because the Union took affirmative steps to endanger Glacier’s property rather than reasonable precautions to mitigate that risk, the NLRA does not arguably protect its conduct,” Barrett wrote.
Three additional conservative justices — Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — wrote separately to reverse the union’s win on other grounds.
Jackson, on the other hand, stood alone in dissenting, marking her first solo dissent in a merits case since joining the bench last year. Jackson has, however, dissented solo outside of the court’s normal docket.

She noted a complaint the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel filed after the state Supreme Court’s ruling that alleged Glacier Northwest engaged in unfair labor practices in relation to the strike.
The majority found that “this issue is not properly before us” because the lower courts had not addressed the significance of the complaint, leaving it for the state courts to consider as the case proceeds.
“The filing of the General Counsel’s administrative complaint necessarily suffices to establish that the Union’s strike conduct is ‘arguably protected’ within the meaning of Garmon. Thus, the General Counsel’s complaint should have marked the end of any court involvement in this matter,” Jackson wrote.

In late March, the prospects of President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) coming together for a deal to raise the debt ceiling that both men found palatable looked dim.
On March 28, Biden flatly rejected a call from McCarthy for a meeting, instead urging the top House Republican to release a budget proposal before they could have a conversation in person.


  

Two days later, McCarthy quipped that he would bring a “soft food” lunch to the White House if that’s what it required for the two leaders to meet in person, an apparent swipe at Biden’s age.
By Memorial Day Weekend, both Biden and McCarthy were publicly complimenting each other and urging their respective parties to pass a deal they had finally signed off on.
“I think he negotiated with me in good faith. He kept his word. He said what he would do. He did what he said he’d do,” Biden said of McCarthy after delivering remarks Sunday at the White House.
“Very professional, very smart. Very tough at the same time,” McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol of his talks with Biden.
The budget deal and simultaneous agreement to lift the debt ceiling for two years marks a significant legislative achievement for two men who until recently had a very limited working relationship, with a big assist from top negotiators like Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) and Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young.
And while the sides traded barbs publicly to argue for their position, a mutual respect and sense of professionalism was persistent as a deal came together, according to officials close to the negotiations.


  

Biden and McCarthy have a shared Irish heritage, but otherwise little else to bond over. After November’s midterms, when it was apparent Republicans would retake the House majority, Biden said he hadn’t had much reason to talk to McCarthy previously.
They finally met Feb. 1 to discuss the budget and other matters, which McCarthy called a “very good discussion.” But aside from interacting at a St. Patrick’s Day celebration on Capitol Hill the next month, the two leaders went weeks without speaking, worrying some in Washington that the stalemate would send the country careening into a default.
White House officials were adamant that there would be no negotiation on the debt ceiling, and Biden for weeks insisted that he would be willing to sit down with McCarthy again once he released a budget proposal.


  

One turning point in talks came when House Republicans in late April passed their own bill that would slash federal spending and extend the government’s borrowing authority into next year. It marked a major win for McCarthy, and it brought the president to the table for budget negotiations.
“Biden has been around a long time. When he wants to, he can be cooperative, and when he doesn’t want to he can be obnoxious,” former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said in an interview.
“I think the White House believed that yelling ‘default’ would work and that in the end Kevin McCarthy would have to cave,” Gingrich added. “And I think it gradually became clear that they can’t bluff him. This is a guy who survived 15 votes to become Speaker. He’s quite capable of being very patient.”


  

Biden finally reached out to McCarthy to invite him and other congressional leaders to meet May 9, but it was not until after a second meeting the following week when there was a development viewed as a major sign of progress.
It was then that Biden and McCarthy appointed lead negotiators to work on hashing out a deal at the staff level. Biden tapped Young, a longtime Capitol Hill aide with strong relationships on both sides of the aisle, while McCarthy leaned on Graves, a top ally and, like Young, a Louisiana native.
As negotiators worked through their differences with a potential default deadline bearing down, Biden and McCarthy met again May 22 for talks that McCarthy described as “productive.”


  

With talks slowly progressing, some Democrats were exasperated that it was McCarthy appearing on camera in front of the West Wing or inside the Capitol to offer regular assessments of how talks were going, while Biden largely remained in the background and avoided declarative public remarks about the state of talks.
But Biden’s relative public silence in the final days of negotiations allowed negotiators to get to a final agreement without applying added pressure or potentially souring the good faith built up with McCarthy over the past month.
“This has been something that both sides, again, came to the table in good faith, understanding how important this is to the American people,” Young said Tuesday. “And that’s what you saw. The American people should at least have some understanding or some comfort that, you know, government is working for them in the sense of coming forward with a bipartisan, reasonable agreement.”


  

McCarthy appears to have avoided a serious threat to his speakership for now, even as some conservatives complained about the deal he cut with Biden and suggested it should be grounds for his removal.
Biden is also dealing with animosity from his left flank, with progressives bothered by the inclusion of tougher work requirements for social safety net recipients.
“I made clear from the start of negotiations that the only path forward was a bipartisan budget agreement,” Biden tweeted Wednesday. “No one got everything they wanted. But that’s the responsibility of governing.”


  

So long as McCarthy retains the gavel, he and Biden will likely face additional future obstacles over the next 18 months. While those close to both men don’t see them as fast friends in the wake of the past month of negotiations, there are indications that they can work together and find common ground.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who was in the room for negotiations in recent weeks, was asked Wednesday if the Biden-McCarthy relationship is closer as the debt ceiling standoff reached its resolution.
“Better, right? But you’ve got two Irish guys that don’t drink,” McHenry quipped to reporters. “The bonding opportunities are not the same for an Irish guy like me. They both have a sweet tooth. Kevin for desserts, broadly. Biden obviously for ice cream.”
“It’s just a different construct for them sitting down and talking,” he added.

Chris Christie (R) is very much a long shot to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2024 — but he has … [+5731 chars],"

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is very much a long shot to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2024 — but he has the potential to scramble the contest, according to sources across the party’s ideological spectrum.
Theories about Christie’s likely impact have become more salient after it emerged Wednesday that he is likely to enter the race next week. 


  

Axios was first to report that Christie will launch his campaign Tuesday at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H.
There are enormous questions around a Christie bid — particularly, whether he can hurt former President Trump, to whom he is now fiercely opposed; and what effect his candidacy might have on Trump’s most serious rival for the nomination, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
If Christie is entering the race with the intention of winning, he has a big mountain to climb.
His political star shined brighter during his previous quest for the White House, in the 2016 cycle — and he still went nowhere. Christie exited the race after the New Hampshire primary, where he placed sixth with less than 8 percent of the vote.
The GOP primary electorate was not in the market for a moderate Northeastern Republican on that occasion. There is no compelling evidence to believe things are different now.
Skeptics contend that a 2024 Christie campaign is more about maintaining relevancy — and perhaps parlaying that relevancy into other work — than anything else.


  

Meanwhile, Christie’s relationship with Trump has gone through more twists and turns than a soap opera.
Having first run against Trump in 2016, Christie swiftly endorsed his rival. 
Trump’s then-chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has said that Christie wavered after the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged, on which the then-candidate was heard boasting about grabbing women by the genitals. In Bannon’s telling, this cost Christie any chance of getting a cabinet role in the Trump administration.


  

Christie was at one stage the head of Trump’s transition planning team, though he was deposed from that position soon after the 2016 election. 
By the time of the 2020 election campaign, Christie was back in the good graces of Trump’s circle to the extent that he helped the then-president prepare for his debates against President Biden. But Christie broke yet again with Trump when the latter refused to acknowledge his defeat in the 2020 election.
More recently, Christie has been more vehement than virtually any other significant GOP figure in his criticisms of Trump.


  

He has referred to Trump’s 2024 bid as a “vanity exercise,” called him “Putin’s puppet” over his view of the war in Ukraine and contended that he is “afraid” to debate other serious candidates.
The reaction from Trump and his allies has been predictably dismissive. 
A Trump spokesman responded to a New York Times inquiry about the “afraid” to debate comment by saying “Who?” — and adding that Christie was “trying to play pretend candidate.”


  

After news broke Wednesday that Christie was planning to enter the race, a GOP operative supportive of Trump told this column, “Trump should welcome Christie into the race, and not just because the more candidates in the primary the better for him…He will act as a constant reminder to our base that the very people they hate also hate Trump.”
The pro-Trump operative also contended that Christie’s candidacy would “signal to GOP base voters that Trump is a threat to the establishment.”
Virtually all the other alternatives to Trump in the presidential race — declared or potential candidates alike — have positioned themselves more as “non-Trump” rather than “anti-Trump.” 


  

That’s true of DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence — who is also expected to enter the race next week — and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.). None has taken on Trump so frontally, as Christie seems likely to do.
Christie does have talents, however. No Republican gets elected twice as governor of a blue state like New Jersey without political skills. And the former governor can be a formidable debater. In 2016, he famously embarrassed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) so badly in one clash that it was perceived to have ruined Rubio’s chances in the race.
Still, Christie was not the beneficiary himself in 2016 — and some wonder whether that pattern could repeat itself in 2024, with attacks by Christie on Trump perhaps helping DeSantis.


  

“Generally, in multi-candidate fields, if you seek to take down another candidate, a third candidate benefits,” said Matt Mackowiak, the chair of the Travis County, Texas, Republican Party.
“I think that is the most likely…You could argue that if Christie is effective at attacking Trump, it would be helpful to DeSantis,” Mackowiak added.
Others, particularly in the rank of Trump critics, were more sanguine about Christie’s chances.
Rick Tyler, who was communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the 2016 campaign, said, “I know the conventional wisdom is that Christie can’t win but I don’t know anymore — and I don’t think anybody does. Christie can stick it to Trump and land punches.”

Tyler, a strong Trump critic, added that Christie “won in a Democratic state — and why wouldn’t we want someone who can win over Democrats?”
For the moment, however, Christie’s bigger problem is how to win over Republicans.

former new jersey gov chris christie is very much a long shot to become the republican presidential nominee in 2024but he has the potential to scramble the contest according to sources across the party’s ideological spectrum
theories about christie’s likely impact have become more salient after it emerged wednesday that he is likely to enter the race next week 


  

axios was first to report that christie will launch his campaign tuesday at saint anselm college in manchester nh
there are enormous questions around a christie bidparticularly whether he can hurt former president trump to whom he is now fiercely opposed and what effect his candidacy might have on trump’s most serious rival for the nomination florida gov ron desantis
if christie is entering the race with the intention of winning he has a big mountain to climb
his political star shined brighter during his previous quest for the white house in the 2016 cycleand he still went nowhere christie exited the race after the new hampshire primary where he placed sixth with less than 8 percent of the vote
the gop primary electorate was not in the market for a moderate northeastern republican on that occasion there is no compelling evidence to believe things are different now
skeptics contend that a 2024 christie campaign is more about maintaining relevancyand perhaps parlaying that relevancy into other workthan anything else


  

meanwhile christie’s relationship with trump has gone through more twists and turns than a soap opera
having first run against trump in 2016 christie swiftly endorsed his rival

3,3,The Hill,Alexander Bolton,Schumer announces agreement to pass debt ceiling bill late Thursday,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4031054-schumer-announces-agreement-to-pass-debt-ceiling-bill-late-thursday/,2023-06-01T23:42:11Z,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced a deal on the Senate floor Thursday evening to vote on amendments to legislation to raise the debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, and get it passe… [+1091 chars]","

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced a deal on the Senate floor Thursday evening to vote on amendments to legislation to raise the debt limit until the start of 2025, and get it passed before markets open Friday morning.  
Schumer announced the Senate would vote on 11 amendments to the bill — 10 sponsored by Republicans and one sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) — and that votes would be limited to 10 minutes to speed the process.  


  

The chamber would then vote on final passage.
The breakthrough came after a multi-hour standoff with defense hawks, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who demanded commitments from Schumer and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) to protect defense spending from a potential 1 percent rescission later in the year and to promise action on a defense supplemental spending bill.  
The Democratic leader entered a joint statement with McConnell into the congressional record before announcing the deal to move forward on amendments. 
The statement clarified that the spending caps imposed by the debt limit deal negotiated by President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) would not prevent the Senate from passing supplemental spending bills to provide more money to the Defense Department or respond to a national emergency.  
“After we finish voting on the amendments, we are immediately considering final passage, and by passing this bill we will avoid default,” Schumer announced. “America can breathe a sigh of relief.”  
Graham, who earlier in the day had threatened to drag out the debate over the debt limit until Tuesday unless his concerns about defense spending were addressed, announced that Schumer had agreed to move a supplemental defense spending bill later this year.  


  

“I’ve been informed that shortly the majority leader will come to the floor and announce his commitment and the body’s commitment to do a supplemental to make sure that the damage done by this bill is at least partially corrected,” Graham said.  
“This bill puts our military behind the eight ball. There’s not one penny in this bill for Ukrainian assistance,” he added.  
Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told reporters after the announcement of the agreement that “there really is a desire by the vast majority of the members of the Senate to actually take care of the defensive needs of our country.” 


  

“The way that the bill was crafted, if we were not able to do all appropriations bills then the non-defense discretionary [spending] came out better and defense came out worse,” he said, referring to a provision in the bill that would cut discretionary spending across the board as a penalty if Congress fails to pass the regular spending bills by year’s end.  
Schumer returned to the floor after the first amendment vote to read aloud his joint statement with McConnell because he wanted to “dispel rumors” that the debt limit deal might shut off the possibility of additional spending on defense and other priorities.

“This debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the Senate’s ability to appropriate emergency supplemental fund to ensure our military capabilities are sufficient to deter China, Russia and other adversaries,” he announced.   


  

He added that the bill would not limit the Senate’s ability to appropriate emergency funding for disaster relief or to respond to the fentanyl crisis.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) added an amendment to the House-passed debt ceiling bill Thursday, seeking to strip approval for a controversial pipeline backed by fellow Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.).
In addition to broader overhauls of the energy permitting process, the debt ceiling deal reached between President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) includes approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline.


  

The more than 300-mile pipeline would transport gas across the state line, stretching from northwest West Virginia through southern Virginia.

Kaine, along with a handful of Virginia Democrats representing the Richmond and northern Virginia regions, have vocally opposed the inclusion of the pipeline approval in the bill.
“I support improving the permitting process for all energy projects. But Congress putting its thumb on the scale so that one specific project doesn’t have to comply with the same process as everyone else is the definition of unfair and opens the door to corruption,” Kaine said in a statement Thursday. 
“I’m introducing this amendment to strip this harmful provision—which is completely unrelated to the debt limit—from the bill because I owe it to the Virginians impacted by the pipeline—including the hundreds of Virginians whose land is being taken away—to ensure the project only proceeds following fair administrative and judicial review.”
Kaine had already announced his plan to file an amendment opposing the pipeline’s inclusion in the bill earlier this week, but his office declined to say whether he would oppose the bill if the amendment is not part of its final form. 
Of the House Democrats who joined him in opposing the pipeline’s inclusion earlier this week, only one, Rep. Bobby Scott (Va.), voted against the bill Wednesday.


  

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) have already announced they will vote against the bill, specifically citing its provisions on the pipeline and fossil fuel development.

Manchin, who like Kaine is up for reelection next year, is a top target for Republicans hoping to retake the Senate in 2024 and securing approval for the pipeline is a key priority for the senator.
The West Virginia Democrat has long been a proponent of both broader permitting reform and approval of the pipeline in particular, arguing it would be vital to meeting consumer need. 


  

Asked about Kaine’s comments Wednesday by West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval, Manchin said he “respectfully disagree[s],” adding, “there’s not been a pipeline that has ever been suggested or possibly built in America that has ever gone through the scrutiny that the MVP has.”

sen tim kaine dva added an amendment to the housepassed debt ceiling bill thursday seeking to strip approval for a controversial pipeline backed by fellow democratic sen joe manchin wva
in addition to broader overhauls of the energy permitting process the debt ceiling deal reached between president biden and speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif includes approval for the mountain valley pipeline

kaine along with a handful of virginia democrats representing the richmond and northern virginia regions have vocally opposed the inclusion of the pipeline approval in the bill
“i support improving the permitting process for all energy projects but congress putting its thumb on the scale so that one specific project doesn’t have to comply with the same process as everyone else is the definition of unfair and opens the door to corruption” kaine said in a statement thursday 
“i’m introducing this amendment to strip this harmful provision—which is completely unrelated to the debt limit—from the bill because i owe it to the virginians impacted by the pipeline—including the hundreds of virginians whose land is being taken away—to ensure the project only proceeds following fair administrative and judicial review”
kaine had already announced his plan to file an amendment opposing the pipeline’s inclusion in the bill earlier this week but his office declined to say whether he would oppose the bill if the amendment is not part of its final form 
of the house democrats who joined him in opposing the pipeline’s inclusion earlier this week only one rep bobby scott va voted against the bill wednesday

Gavriil Grigorov, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via APRussian President Vladimir Putin listens to Vitaly Mutko, the chief executive officer of Dom.RF, at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia.… [+7062 chars]","

It was another bad week in Ukraine for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and his commanding general, Valery Gerasimov — bad enough to launch criminal retaliation strikes against civilian targets in Kyiv, which largely failed anyway.
Even the most loyal of the Russian propagandists are at this point bewildered by the self-defeating military strategy and lack of resolve by the Kremlin to go all-in. Vladimir Solovyov called upon Russian citizens to “recognize there is a war going on,” “move to a war footing” and recognize “we’re fighting against NATO.” He then called for more airstrikes on Ukrainian cities.


  

Sixteen months into the war, Putin and his generals still do not have an answer to Ukraine. Russian ground forces are being routed and humiliated routinely. Entire formations with their officers have surrendered. UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles strike with impunity at locations once considered not at risk. 
And Russia’s border is not secure, either. Elements of the pro-Ukrainian Russian Volunteer Corps, alongside the Freedom of Russia Legion, demonstrated this on May 22 when they conducted a raid in the Belgorod Oblast. The skies over Moscow remain porous as well. The drone strike on the flagpole atop the Kremlin prior to the May 9 Victory Day Parade was repeated on May 30, inviting yet again the wrath of Wagner CEO Yevgeny Prigozhin and ultra-nationalist Igor Strelkov on Putin’s inability to protect Russian citizens living in the capital city.
No amount of spin from the Kremlin can change those inconvenient truths, not that some haven’t tried. A Baghdad Bob-like moment occurred on May 30 when Shoigu reported incredible battlefield successes. “Russian troops continue to inflict effective fire on the enemy,” he wrote. He added that “196 HIMARS [rockets] were intercepted and destroyed, along with 16 HARM missiles and 29 Storm Shadow cruise missiles.” 
Shoigu went on to claim that Russia had struck a U.S. Patriot missile system in Kyiv and “liquidated” 70 Ukrainian raiders during a “counterterrorism operation in Belgorod.” He concluded by claiming that eight Ukrainian drones launched in a “terrorist action targeting civilians” in Moscow were destroyed. The assembled military officers in the audience sat stoically, listening to what they surely recognized as farcical Kremlin propaganda. 
Retired Russian naval officer Konstantin Sivkov, tried deluding his audience that the drone attacks on Moscow had been, in actuality, “very positive, because they’ll help to mobilize Russian society against the enemy.” Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin likewise downplayed the effectiveness of the attack saying the “UAV attack caused minor damage to several buildings. All the city’s emergency services are on the scene. They are investigating the circumstances of what happened. No one has been seriously injured so far.” 
Russian spin notwithstanding, the drone strikes provided yet another psychological jab that is picking at the scab of the Russian psyche. What was described as a “special military operation” is in its 16th month now, and as Igor Girkin apprised, something as militarily limited as the special military operation should not have involved Ukrainian strikes “against Engels or Moscow, where since Soviet times [they had] the best air defense and missile defense system in Russia.” 


  

The Kremlin, in the absence of a sustained conventional offensive capability, was increasingly resorting to propagandists selling Putin’s retaliation strikes against Ukrainian civilians as though they were decisive battlefield successes. Yet as Russian missile and drone strikes lose effectiveness against a U.S. and NATO supplied integrated air defense network, Putin is shifting back to implied threats of nuclear escalation and Chernobyl-like environmental disasters. 
This past week, Putin signed two documents designed to send one nuclear message to the U.S. and NATO. The first provided for the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, although control is solely retained by the Kremlin. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko claimed that the “tactical nuclear weapons were already on the move.” 
Then, on Monday, Putin signed legislation into law withdrawing Russia from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Both decrees are creating an ominous new dimension in regard to the four Ukrainian regions Moscow illegally annexed — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. In the past, Putin has vowed to defend Russia territories, “including the annexed regions, with any means at his military’s disposal, including nuclear weapons.”


  

Short of using nukes and lacking adequate conventional options, Moscow is for now electing to create environmental disasters instead. On May 26, Russian forces blew up the Karlivka Dam in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine with a missile strike, sending water downstream and leading to the evacuation of civilians from their homes along the Vovcha River. The resulting floods did disrupt “Ukrainian military operations near the front lines,” while disrupting Kyiv’s ability to resupply and sustain deployment of those units.
New reports from the Ukraine Defense Ministry on May 26 also suggest Russia is planning a major accident at Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in a ‘false flag’ operation to “thwart Ukraine’s imminently expected counteroffensive.” In faking a Ukrainian attack on the plant and causing “the leakage of the radioactive substances,” the Kremlin is apparently anticipating it can “trigger an international investigation which would require a ceasefire, allowing Russia to use the break in fighting to better prepare for Ukraine’s counteroffensive.”
Ukraine, however, remains undeterred and unwilling to give in to Russian nuclear blackmail. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky defiantly announced on May 29 that a decision had been made concerning the timing of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. The head games continue — real and imagined, including action, reaction, counteraction — only this time, it is Ukraine dictating the conditions.

		How Trump ended up with Judge Cannon 	

Deep strikes, raids, reconnaissance in force, supporting efforts, main effort — Gerasimov must now prepare for all contingencies along a 900-mile front. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian army gets stronger and the Russian soldier in his foxhole is left to wonder.
Putin, essentially, is down to his nukes in Ukraine. And even he likely knows that they are not a viable or winning option. The question is no longer whether Russia conventionally loses in Ukraine, but when.

Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, on Thursday accused the U.S. of “gangster-like” hypocrisy for its criticisms of North Korea’s failed attempt to launch a military spy satellite. 
Kim Yo Jong said the U.S. “is letting loose a hackneyed gibberish prompted by its brigandish and abnormal thinking,” knocking the country for criticizing North Korea’s satellite plans when it has launched satellites of its own. 


  

“The far-fetched logic that only the DPRK should not be allowed to do so according to the [U.N. Security Council’s] ‘resolution’ which bans the use of ballistic rocket technology irrespective of its purpose, though other countries are doing so, is clearly a gangster-like and wrong one of seriously violating the DPRK’s right to use space and illegally oppressing it,” she said in a statement broadcast on state media. 
North Korea admitted Wednesday it tried and failed to launch a spy satellite. The country planned to do so to monitor what it labeled “reckless” military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea in the region.
The Biden administration earlier in the week condemned North Korea for the plans.

“The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its launch using ballistic missile technology, which is a brazen violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, raises tensions, and risks destabilizing the security situation in the region and beyond,” National Security Council spokesperson Adam Hodge said in a statement.

Public health advocacy groups are sounding the alarm over a provision in the debt ceiling deal to claw back about $27 billion in unspent pandemic relief money, arguing it could have consequences for future public health initiatives. 
Unspent COVID-19 dollars have long been a target of Republicans, and taking back some of that money gives Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) a political win.


  

The federal COVID-19 public health emergency ended earlier this month, and President Biden had indicated he was open to a deal that included coronavirus funding rescissions. That clawback was included in the final measure to raise the debt limit, which cleared the House in a bipartisan 314-117 vote Wednesday and now heads to the Senate, where leaders hope it will pass quickly ahead of a Monday deadline given by the Treasury Department.
According to the White House, some of the unspent money will now be used to help shore up nondefense spending. 
“The appropriators will use some of that money to spread around how they see fit,” said Shalanda Young, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. “We didn’t get into the individual line items in this bill.”
According to the Congressional Budget Office, a majority of the reductions would come from the Public Health and Social Service Emergency Fund, as well as from certain infrastructure and disaster relief programs.
Over the course of the pandemic, Congress appropriated nearly $5 trillion to various programs and agencies — including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Small Business Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Transportation Department.
Across HHS, Congress would take back more than $13 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies for programs including vaccine efficacy and supply chain monitoring.


  

The funds were unspent for a variety of reasons. According to a summary circulated by the White House and obtained by The Hill, some of the programs had concluded, and there was no longer demand for others.  
Still, advocates said they are concerned lawmakers have not learned lessons from the pandemic. 
“I think the issue is that it just speaks to this notion of nothing happened between 2020 and 2023,” said Ellie Dehoney, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at Research!America.


  

“There seems to be this notion that we can do less than we did before, and somehow come out ahead. And that’s really, really worrisome,” Dehoney said.
HHS saw a tremendous infusion of cash during the pandemic. According to the Government Accountability Office, six pandemic relief laws appropriated about $349 billion to HHS’s Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund between March 2020 and March 2021. 
For context, the White House’s 2024 budget request would provide about $278 million for the emergency fund, which would be about $160 million more than what was enacted in the fiscal 2023 spending bill.


  

The White House summary indicated there was about $20 billion remaining in the fund and said it was able to keep $10 billion to develop the next generation of vaccines, test procurement and research into long COVID.
Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said he understands the agreement was probably the best-case scenario with Republicans in control of the House. 
Still, his primary concern was that public health is being sacrificed to make fiscal ends meet.


  

“They didn’t do this to the military budget. The military didn’t just crash the economy … but an infectious disease did. And we’re still inadequately investing in infectious disease right now,” Benjamin said.
“I’ve always believed that clawbacks are bad ideas because you always take back money that at some point you wished you had available.”
But other experts said the immediate impact will not be significant because the White House was able to protect key investments.


  

Jen Kates, a senior vice president and global health expert at KFF, said it’s not totally clear what the funds would have been used for. 
As recently as last year, the Biden administration was asking Congress for more money. Republicans rebuffed the requests and insisted the White House hadn’t given an adequate accounting of where the previously appropriated funds had been spent. 
“I think that the federal government has not always shown the details of what [money] is left and why. And I think that doesn’t make your case very well,” Kates said. 


  

“Congress has basically said COVID is over … they want this money to come back. They have not had any appetite to provide more funding. In their view, COVID is done, and so the fact that this money was sitting there without a clear sense of why did not help [the administration’s] case,” Kates said.

The larger concern for many is the legislation’s cap on nondefense discretionary spending will be kept roughly flat for 2024 and then given a 1 percent increase in 2025.
The cap could significantly curb spending for health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, which have been facing GOP attacks. 
“We’re in a precarious place. And, you know, we’re not treating strategic budgeting in that way,” Dehoney said. “And so, what worries me is the caps because the caps really demonstrate, I think, a disconnect between what we’re up against as a nation and what our investment strategy is for our nation.”

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has changed her position on the public release of the tapes documenting the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, warning Friday that their release could “put the security of the Capitol at risk.” 
Greene said in an interview on the right-wing channel Real America’s Voice that releasing the video footage publicly would jeopardize the Capitol’s security and endanger those who were present at the Capitol grounds but did not enter the Capitol nor commit crimes. 


  

“And this is our real concern with the videotapes. If we released these videotapes just widely for the public — number one, we put the security of the Capitol at risk, because there’s over 1,700 video cameras,” she said. 
“Number two, we also endanger many Americans that were simply standing on the Capitol grounds, maybe never even walked through the Capitol or committed any crimes, but they could have just walked further than where the barrier was simply because the barrier was torn down by the time they got there,” Greene continued. 
She said she is concerned about “leftist groups” that would use facial-recognition technology to identify those seen in the videos to “hand them over” to the FBI and Justice Department. She said that some people committed violence and broke the law and should be held accountable but many others did not commit crimes. 
Greene also later criticized in a tweet a group called Sedition Hunters, which is a “global community of open-source intelligence investigators” that work to help the FBI and Capitol Police identify people who allegedly committed crimes during the insurrection.
“Sedition Hunters would spend every second of every day analyzing the videos in order to hunt innocent people that just stood on Capitol grounds on J6,” Greene later tweeted. 
The group’s website states that its members investigate publicly available photos and videos of rioters who are wanted by the FBI and Capitol Police for alleged crimes.


  

Greene has previously called for the public release of the tapes so “everyone knows what did or didn’t happen.”

She announced Wednesday that that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) planned to release the tapes to three outlets that would receive “unfettered access.” She said two of the recipients of the tapes would be Just the News founder John Solomon, who interviewed Greene on Friday, and American Greatness senior writer Julie Kelly. 
McCarthy released 44,000 hours of footage to then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson earlier this year, yielding criticism from Democrats who argued that it could put Capitol security procedures at risk and allow Carlson, who has downplayed the violence from the attack, to distort what happened.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) shouted down a heckler who called him a “fascist” at a presidential campaign rally in South Carolina on Friday.
As DeSantis talked about parents’ rights in education, a woman in the crowd in Lexington, S.C., shouted, “What about the parents’ rights to health care, to their kids’ health care? You’re a f—— fascist.”


  

“Yeah, well, thank you, thank you,” DeSantis responded as the crowd booed the heckler. “We’re not gonna let you impose an agenda on our kids. We’re gonna stand up for our kids. We’re gonna make sure to do it right.”
“Those people like that in Florida are the people we beat every single day on policy,” he added. “We do not let them win. We win all these battles. We’re not letting them indoctrinate our kids, not on our watch.”

The economy added 339,000 jobs in May, once again blowing past analysts’ expectations and showing the strength of the U.S. labor market — even as the unemployment rate made one of its sharpest jumps in months, from 3.4 percent in April to to 3.7 percent last month.
The mixed results could be a Rorschach test for the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates up to 5.1 percent, the expected ending point for 2023. That gives the central bank some liberty to see what it wants to see in the economy.


  

Friday’s jobs report from the Labor Department confirmed a slowing trend in wage growth.
The decline is bad news for workers but good news for the Fed, whose job it is to keep prices stable at the expense of higher take-home pay.
Inflation watch: Fed: Companies boasted ‘unusually high profits’ after supply issues eased
The report also showed a sharp increase in unemployment for Black Americans while unemployment for Hispanic Americans tied a record-low. The civilian labor force increased by 130,000 people, while the labor force participation rate held steady at 62.6 percent.
Here’s what to take away from Friday’s jobs report.
Reductions in self-employment could be behind the unemployment spike
Some analysts Friday were paying attention to a rise in the number of people who left self-employed status to start their own businesses, implying the sharp uptick in unemployment could be more trivial than the 0.3 percentage-point increase would suggest.


  

“The most banal possible explanation for the weak household numbers: 412,000 people left self-employed unincorporated status [while] 302,000 people became self-employed incorporated,” wrote Adam Ozimek, chief economist for the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank and advocacy organization.
“Self employed workers [are] becoming small businesses.”
Other economists sounded a more negative tone, pointing to more general employment trends in the economy.


  

“Unemployment rate rose for all the wrong reasons. More employed people [moved] into unemployment and fewer unemployed workers [found] jobs,” wrote Nick Bunker, an economist with online job platform Indeed.
Wage growth is trending downward, but low-earners are still seeing gains

Wages in May rose by 0.3 percent, or 11 cents, to $33.44 an hour, the Labor Department reported. Over the past 12 months, wages have increased by 4.3 percent — a dip from a 4.4-percent annual gain in April. 
“Nominal wage growth has unmistakably slowed down, and is now at levels approaching those from 2019,” University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Arin Dube confirmed.


  

Dean Baker, senior economist at the Center for Policy and Economic Research, noted that wages grew at 4.0 percent annual rate over the last three months and 3.9 percent rate over the last six months.
While wage growth is cooling, earners at the bottom-end of the income spectrum are still pulling in the best wage gains —  one of the hallmarks of the post-pandemic recovery.
Wages for leisure and hospitality sector workers increased at a 7.9 percent rate taken over the last three months, according to Friday’s data.


  

“The pandemic increased the elasticity of labor supply to firms in the low-wage labor market, reducing employer market power and spurring rapid relative wage growth among young non-college workers who disproportionately moved from lower-paying to higher-paying and potentially more-productive jobs,” Dube wrote in a paper earlier this year.
Employment for Black Americans fell off a cliff in May
Black unemployment increased by nearly a full percentage point, jumping to 5.6 percent from 4.7 in April, which had been a record low.
The spike concerned some economists, who warned that Black Americans are often the first to lose their jobs as a recession takes hold of the economy.


  

“The increase in Black unemployment from 4.7 percent to 5.6 percent is the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the economy. The historic gains we’ve seen for Black workers were always fragile, and we’re seeing what happens when the Fed raises rates 10 times in a row,” economist Rakeen Mabud of the progressive think tank Groundwork Collaborative wrote online.
Employment for Hispanic Americans moved in the opposite direction, falling to 4 percent from 4.4 percent in April.
Those numbers follow a rise in the number of job openings, which increased to 10.1 million and brought the ratio of job-seekers to available jobs back up to 1.8.

The health care and social assistance sector added 74,600 jobs in May, while the professional services sector added 64,000 jobs.
Other notable contributors to May’s hiring surge include the transportation and warehousing sector with 24,200 jobs, construction with 25,000 and retail trade with 11,600.
The information service sector dropped 9,000 jobs as tech companies shed workers and grabbed headlines. Nondurable goods producers also let go of 5,000 jobs in May.
No clear answer for the Fed

The simultaneous boom in hiring and spike in joblessness poses a challenge for the Fed ahead of its next policy meeting in June.
Fed officials have been pondering whether to pause their rapid series of rate hikes, which began in March 2022, later this month. 
While inflation is falling steadily and the broader economy is slowing, stubbornly high price growth and steady job gains have raised tough questions for the Fed. 
Many market commentators noted that the mixed May jobs report will offer Fed officials the opportunity to cherry-pick the data they like to build a narrative for the economy that they’d most like to see.

“Job growth is humungous, but unemployment is up and wage growth slowing,” New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote Friday. “If you want to make the case that the economy is running too hot, and we need more rate hikes, you can find data to support that. If you want to argue that a soft landing is in progress, there are numbers for that too.”
Markets currently expect the Fed to pause at its next rate-setting committee meeting later this month.
“Not a ton to glean from this report. Things are probably fine but [we] don’t want to sound complacent. [There are] more conflicting signals in contrast to the last two reports, when job growth was uniformly impressive,” Skanda Amarnath, director of the Employ America think tank, which advocates for high levels of employment, wrote Friday.

The Senate on Thursday night capped four months of contentious debate and voted to send a compromise bill to President Biden’s desk that extends the government’s borrowing authority until January 2025 and staves off a potential default next week. 
A large bipartisan majority of the Senate voted 63-36 to approve the bill, which already passed the House on Wednesday night. 


  

The approval came after the Senate clinched an agreement to conduct a series of amendment votes Thursday night and move directly to final passage; the normally slow-moving chamber raced through a dozen votes in just over three hours.
“By passing this bill, we will avoid default tonight. America can breathe a sigh of relief,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declared on the Senate floor.  
“From the start, avoiding default has been our North Star. The consequences of default would be catastrophic,” he said. “For all the ups and downs and twists and turns it took to get here, it is so good for this country that both parties have come together at last to avoid default.” 
Senate Republican conservatives including Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined Republican defense hawks including Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in voting against the bill.  
A total of 31 Republicans voted against the measure, including Senate Republican Conference Committee Chairman John Barrasso (Wyo.). 
Senate Democrats, meanwhile, weren’t happy about caps on nondefense discretionary spending, tougher work requirements for federal food assistance and approval of a controversial natural gas pipeline — but the overwhelming majority of Democrats voted for the bill to avoid a default.  


  

Just four Democrats voted against the measure: Sens. John Fetterman (Pa.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), along with Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen warned congressional leaders that the federal government might run out of money June 5; if Congress didn’t raise the debt ceiling by then, it could cause an economic catastrophe. 
Biden said in a statement Thursday night he would address the country Friday and looks “forward to signing this bill into law as soon as possible.”


  

“No one gets everything they want in a negotiation, but make no mistake: This bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the American people,” he said.
The bill, which was negotiated between Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), would rescind some of the funding provided to the IRS in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act but otherwise leaves in place many of the Democratic priorities enacted in the last Congress. 
It would not impose tougher work requirements for Medicaid recipients, something Biden said was off-limits, though it would expand work requirements for food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. 


  

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) hailed the legislation as a major win for Republicans.  
“I think Speaker McCarthy should be congratulated on capturing a number of priorities,” he said, noting that Congress enacted approximately $2.7 trillion in new spending on party-line votes when Democrats were in full control in 2021 and 2022.  
“So, we’ve gone from one party spending $2.7 trillion in two years to a discussion about actually reducing government spending. So, I think the American people’s decision to change House has already yielded benefits for our country,” he said.  


  

The legislation would provide $886 billion for defense, which negotiators described as a 3-percent increase, and $637 billion for nondefense programs, according to a White House summary.  
It would rescind $28 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief funds and enact modest reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act to speed the permitting of energy projects.  
It would impose an across-the-board, 1-percent cut on discretionary spending if all 12 annual appropriations bills aren’t enacted by the end of the calendar year. 


  

But several Senate conservatives panned the bill for not cutting nearly as much off the federal deficit as advertised.  
“When I read the legislation that deals with these provisions, without fail, every one of the major provisions, the things that I thought were significant, didn’t do what they were purported to do, what they were supposed to do. And that’s concerning,” Lee told reporters.  
The Utah conservative pilloried the bill this week as a “fake response to burdensome debt” and a “victory of expediency over integrity.”  


  

Lee last week threatened to use “every procedural tool” at his disposal to impede any debt limit bill that didn’t include “substantial spending and budgetary reforms.” 
But conservatives’ appetite to drag out the debate on the bill over the weekend was dampened by the huge bipartisan vote it got in the House.  
Republican defense hawks had a different set of complaints about the legislation.  
Graham, one of several defense hawks who held the bill up for hours Thursday in an effort to extract a promise from Schumer and McConnell to safeguard defense spending, slammed the legislation for not funding additional military assistance to Ukraine.  
Graham argued the bill would actually cut the defense budget when measured against the rate of inflation.  
“I’ve heard House leaders suggest this bill fully funds the military. For that to be true, you would have to believe that the military is OK if you cut their budget $42 billion below inflation. The party of Ronald Reagan would never allow inflation to reduce defense capabilities,” he said.  
Graham teamed up with other Republican defense hawks to demand assurances from Schumer and McConnell to move the appropriations bills on time to avoid the potential of a 1 percent rescission and to move a supplemental defense spending package. 
Schumer entered into the official record two statements promising to make every effort to ensure the Pentagon will have the money it needs and to move emergency spending packages if necessary. 
“This debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the Senate’s ability to appropriate emergency supplemental funds to ensure our military capabilities are sufficient to deter China, Russia and our other adversaries,” he pledged on the Senate floor.  
Those assurances paved the way for colleagues to vote on 11 amendments to the bill and then final passage.  
All of the amendments failed; Schumer warned that any changes to the legislation would require it to be sent back to the House and put the nation perilously close to default.  
Kaine, the only Democrat to offer an amendment to the bill, failed in his attempt to strip language from the deal to expedite the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline through his home state.  
Though Schumer and McConnell were able to quell the revolt from Republican defense hawks, it’s uncertain whether they’ll be able to deliver on their promise to get all 12 appropriations bills passed by Christmas or, if necessary, a supplemental spending package to Biden’s desk. 
Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) said McCarthy didn’t sign off on the agreement between Senate leaders and defense-minded GOP senators. 
“I didn’t have conversations with him about that. I know our goal … was trying to produce a result in the Senate that would help us get an outcome that we could put on the president’s desk without sending it back to the House of Representatives,” he said.

Asked how confident he is about a defense supplemental spending bill passing later in the year, Thune said, “hard to say.” 
“It was important for some of our members have folks on the record acknowledging there clearly could be a need, will be a need, for our national security interests,” he said.

the senate on thursday night capped four months of contentious debate and voted to send a compromise bill to president biden’s desk that extends the government’s borrowing authority until january 2025 and staves off a potential default next week 
a large bipartisan majority of the senate voted 6336 to approve the bill which already passed the house on wednesday night 


  

the approval came after the senate clinched an agreement to conduct a series of amendment votes thursday night and move directly to final passage the normally slowmoving chamber raced through a dozen votes in just over three hours
“by passing this bill we will avoid default tonight america can breathe a sigh of relief” senate majority leader chuck schumer dny declared on the senate floor  
“from the start avoiding default has been our north star the consequences of default would be catastrophic” he said “for all the ups and downs and twists and turns it took to get here it is so good for this country that both parties have come together at last to avoid default” 
senate republican conservatives including sens rand paul rky and mike lee rutah joined republican defense hawks including sens roger wicker rmiss lindsey graham rsc dan sullivan ralaska and tom cotton rark in voting against the bill  
a total of 31 republicans voted against the measure including senate republican conference committee chairman john barrasso wyo 
senate democrats meanwhile weren’t happy about caps on nondefense discretionary spending tougher work requirements for federal food assistance and approval of a controversial natural gas pipelinebut the overwhelming majority of democrats voted for the bill to avoid a default  


  

just four democrats voted against the measure sens john fetterman pa ed markey mass jeff merkley ore elizabeth warren mass along with bernie sanders ivt
treasury department secretary janet yellen warned congressional leaders that the federal government might run out of money june 5 if congress didn’t raise the debt ceiling by then it could cause an economic catastrophe 
biden said in a statement thursday night he would address the country friday and looks “forward to signing this bill into law as soon as possible”


  

“no one gets everything they want in a negotiation but make no mistake this bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the american people” he said
the bill which was negotiated between biden and speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif would rescind some of the funding provided to the irs in last year’s inflation reduction act but otherwise leaves in place many of the democratic priorities enacted in the last congress 
it would not impose tougher work requirements for medicaid recipients something biden said was offlimits though it would expand work requirements for food stamps and temporary assistance for needy families 


  

senate republican leader mitch mcconnell ky hailed the legislation as a major win for republicans  
“i think speaker mccarthy should be congratulated on capturing a number of priorities” he said noting that congress enacted approximately 27 trillion in new spending on partyline votes when democrats were in full control in 2021 and 2022  
“so we’ve gone from one party spending 27 trillion in two years to a discussion about actually reducing government spending so i think the american people’s decision to change house has already yielded benefits for our country” he said  


  

the legislation would provide 886 billion for defense which negotiators described as a 3percent increase and 637 billion for nondefense programs according to a white house summary  
it would rescind 28 billion in unspent covid19 relief funds and enact modest reforms to the national environmental policy act to speed the permitting of energy projects  
it would impose an acrosstheboard 1percent cut on discretionary spending if all 12 annual appropriations bills aren’t enacted by the end of the calendar year 


  

but several senate conservatives panned the bill for not cutting nearly as much off the federal deficit as advertised  
“when i read the legislation that deals with these provisions without fail every one of the major provisions the things that i thought were significant didn’t do what they were purported to do what they were supposed to do and that’s concerning” lee told reporters  
the utah conservative pilloried the bill this week as a “fake response to burdensome debt” and a “victory of expediency over integrity”  


  

lee last week threatened to use “every procedural tool” at his disposal to impede any debt limit bill that didn’t include “substantial spending and budgetary reforms” 
but conservatives’ appetite to drag out the debate on the bill over the weekend was dampened by the huge bipartisan vote it got in the house  
republican defense hawks had a different set of complaints about the legislation  
graham one of several defense hawks who held the bill up for hours thursday in an effort to extract a promise from schumer and mcconnell to safeguard defense spending slammed the legislation for not funding additional military assistance to ukraine  
graham argued the bill would actually cut the defense budget when measured against the rate of inflation  
“i’ve heard house leaders suggest this bill fully funds the military for that to be true you would have to believe that the military is ok if you cut their budget 42 billion below inflation the party of ronald reagan would never allow inflation to reduce defense capabilities” he said  
graham teamed up with other republican defense hawks to demand assurances from schumer and mcconnell to move the appropriations bills on time to avoid the potential of a 1 percent rescission and to move a supplemental defense spending package 
schumer entered into the official record two statements promising to make every effort to ensure the pentagon will have the money it needs and to move emergency spending packages if necessary 
“this debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the senate’s ability to appropriate emergency supplemental funds to ensure our military capabilities are sufficient to deter china russia and our other adversaries” he pledged on the senate floor

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) shouted down a heckler who called him a “fascist” at a presidential campaign rally in South Carolina on Friday.
As DeSantis talked about parents’ rights in education, a woman in the crowd in Lexington, S.C., shouted, “What about the parents’ rights to health care, to their kids’ health care? You’re a f—— fascist.”


  

“Yeah, well, thank you, thank you,” DeSantis responded as the crowd booed the heckler. “We’re not gonna let you impose an agenda on our kids. We’re gonna stand up for our kids. We’re gonna make sure to do it right.”
“Those people like that in Florida are the people we beat every single day on policy,” he added. “We do not let them win. We win all these battles. We’re not letting them indoctrinate our kids, not on our watch.”

Ukraine is facing sky-high expectations ahead of its upcoming counteroffensive, raising a litany of dangers if Kyiv fails to make major advances against entrenched Russian forces.
Lackluster results could hurt Ukraine’s international support moving forward, embolden critics of continued military support and ultimately benefit Russia. 


  

Ukraine has received nearly all of the promised military aid from Western allies, including infantry fighting vehicles and main battle tanks, all of which are upping the global pressure for Ukrainians to succeed.
But victory is far from assured. 
“Sometimes, war is sold like a consumer product, where there’s a lot of hype and a lot of hope,” said Bill Astore, a retired U.S. Air Force veteran and a senior fellow with the Eisenhower Media Network. “That is contrary to the reality we often see.”
For months, messaging from Ukraine and its allies has been that Western armor, such as Germany’s Leopard tanks and American-made Stryker vehicles, are far superior to Russian equipment and will swing the war in Ukraine’s favor.
Yet Russian forces are dug in across the 600-mile front line in eastern Ukraine, and Kyiv will not have the element of surprise that helped its successful counteroffensives last year in the Kherson and Kharkiv regions.
At the same time, the counteroffensive, anticipated to stretch until the late fall, is Ukraine’s one chance this year to prove its capabilities, according to military analysts.


  

Edward Arnold, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said Ukraine is “racing against time” because the longer Russian forces remain in eastern territory, the more likely the war becomes static and occupation becomes a fait accompli.
“They don’t need to do everything, but they need to do enough for that support to continue for at least another year,” Arnold said. “They need to deliver a pretty significant play to Russian forces this year, and then it will be on Western backers to decide whether that is enough.”
The hype around the counteroffensive has been necessary to shore up support, keep troops optimistic and get the equipment and weapons needed to sustain military forces.


  

But even Ukraine has tried to temper expectations. 
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said expectations were “definitely overheated” in a late April interview with a Ukrainian news outlet.
“Everyone wants another win,” Reznikov said, warning allies to not set expectations so high they get disappointed later. “They want the next victory. It’s normal, these are emotions.”


  

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last month his troops needed more time before launching the offensive, but analysts have assessed it has already begun and forces are probing for weaknesses in the Russian lines.
Allies are anticipating big territorial gains, including the hope Ukraine will strike in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region and cut off a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014 and serves as a major supply hub for Russian troops. Other significant territorial gains are expected in the Luhansk or Donetsk regions, which make up the eastern Donbas.
But satellite images have shown entrenched Russian troops all across the front, particularly around Crimea and the Zaporizhzhia region.


  

The tranche of vehicles and advanced weapons provided by Western allies was donated in part with the expectation that Ukraine could use it in a strategy of combined arms maneuver warfare.
In that military tactic, Ukrainians would work in sync with aircraft, vehicular armor and infantry to break through Russia’s fortifications, which — if done correctly — would put already-struggling Russian forces on their backfoot.
But combined arms maneuvers are difficult to pull off, require extensive training and even the best armies can sometimes fail to coordinate properly, according to experts.


  

Last month, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. has done “everything we can” to supply Ukraine with the capabilities to succeed, but he stopped short of saying he was confident in a Ukrainian victory.
“It’s not just the stuff, it’s the know-how and how to use that stuff in the field,” Kirby said at a press briefing. “As for the actual execution of any kind of spring counteroffensive, that’s going to be up to President Zelensky.”
Military analysts expect Ukraine to succeed in breaking through Russian lines in some places, but it’s less clear when that will happen and how dramatic of a punch it will be.


  

Instead of defining success along the lines of huge territorial gains, Western allies should look at any breakthrough of Russian lines as a victory, said Hein Goemans, the director of the Peter D. Watson Center for Conflict and Cooperation at the University of Rochester.
“That’s still showing that you won’t be tied down in the war of attrition because you have achieved a breakthrough and you can do that elsewhere,” Goemans said. “If you show that you can do this consistently, then you will force [allies] to change their expectations, and that’s what we need.”
Still, those marginal wins are unlikely to pull dramatic headlines at a time when public support for continued military aid is slowly dropping in the U.S. and the 2024 election is just around the corner.
Former President Trump is trying to sell himself as a candidate who can end the Ukraine war in 24 hours, while GOP rival and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who announced his 2024 campaign last week, has questioned continued American military support.
Privately, the Biden administration is worried about the counteroffensive failing, according to Politico.
Officials are concerned it will embolden critics who say Ukraine can’t push Russian forces out of its territory and anger politicians who clamored for the U.S. to provide more weapons ahead of time, such as long-range artillery and fighter jets.
Dashed hopes will also benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
“If Ukraine falls flat on its face, Putin will use that to say, ‘There’s the evidence that we’re on the right track,’” said Astore from the Eisenhower Media Network.

Arnold, from the Royal United Services Institute, put it much less mildly.
He assessed that Western allies donated so much ahead of the offensive because they understood what was at stake if the offensive fails — Ukraine’s freedom and future place in the world order. 
“Everything is riding on this offensive,” Arnold said. “You don’t want to put too much pressure on them, [but] you can’t help it.”

ukraine is facing skyhigh expectations ahead of its upcoming counteroffensive raising a litany of dangers if kyiv fails to make major advances against entrenched russian forces
lackluster results could hurt ukraine’s international support moving forward embolden critics of continued military support and ultimately benefit russia 


  

ukraine has received nearly all of the promised military aid from western allies including infantry fighting vehicles and main battle tanks all of which are upping the global pressure for ukrainians to succeed
but victory is far from assured 
“sometimes war is sold like a consumer product where there’s a lot of hype and a lot of hope” said bill astore a retired us air force veteran and a senior fellow with the eisenhower media network “that is contrary to the reality we often see”
for months messaging from ukraine and its allies has been that western armor such as germany’s leopard tanks and americanmade stryker vehicles are far superior to russian equipment and will swing the war in ukraine’s favor
yet russian forces are dug in across the 600mile front line in eastern ukraine and kyiv will not have the element of surprise that helped its successful counteroffensives last year in the kherson and kharkiv regions
at the same time the counteroffensive anticipated to stretch until the late fall is ukraine’s one chance this year to prove its capabilities according to military analysts


  

edward arnold a research fellow at the royal united services institute said ukraine is “racing against time” because the longer russian forces remain in eastern territory the more likely the war becomes static and occupation becomes a fait accompli
“they don’t need to do everything but they need to do enough for that support to continue for at least another year” arnold said “they need to deliver a pretty significant play to russian forces this year and then it will be on western backers to decide whether that is enough”
the hype around the counteroffensive has been necessary to shore up support keep troops optimistic and get the equipment and weapons needed to sustain military forces


  

but even ukraine has tried to temper expectations 
ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov said expectations were “definitely overheated” in a late april interview with a ukrainian news outlet
“everyone wants another win” reznikov said warning allies to not set expectations so high they get disappointed later “they want the next victory it’s normal these are emotions”


  

ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said last month his troops needed more time before launching the offensive but analysts have assessed it has already begun and forces are probing for weaknesses in the russian lines
allies are anticipating big territorial gains including the hope ukraine will strike in the southeastern zaporizhzhia region and cut off a land bridge to the crimean peninsula which russia illegally annexed in 2014 and serves as a major supply hub for russian troops other significant territorial gains are expected in the luhansk or donetsk regions which make up the eastern donbas
but satellite images have shown entrenched russian troops all across the front particularly around crimea and the zaporizhzhia region


  

the tranche of vehicles and advanced weapons provided by western allies was donated in part with the expectation that ukraine could use it in a strategy of combined arms maneuver warfare
in that military tactic ukrainians would work in sync with aircraft vehicular armor and infantry to break through russia’s fortifications whichif done correctlywould put alreadystruggling russian forces on their backfoot
but combined arms maneuvers are difficult to pull off require extensive training and even the best armies can sometimes fail to coordinate properly according to experts


  

last month white house national security council spokesperson john kirby said the us has done “everything we can” to supply ukraine with the capabilities to succeed but he stopped short of saying he was confident in a ukrainian victory
“it’s not just the stuff it’s the knowhow and how to use that stuff in the field” kirby said at a press briefing “as for the actual execution of any kind of spring counteroffensive that’s going to be up to president zelensky”
military analysts expect ukraine to succeed in breaking through russian lines in some places but it’s less clear when that will happen and how dramatic of a punch it will be


  

instead of defining success along the lines of huge territorial gains western allies should look at any breakthrough of russian lines as a victory said hein goemans the director of the peter d watson center for conflict and cooperation at the university of rochester
“that’s still showing that you won’t be tied down in the war of attrition because you have achieved a breakthrough and you can do that elsewhere” goemans said “if you show that you can do this consistently then you will force allies to change their expectations and that’s what we need”
still those marginal wins are unlikely to pull dramatic headlines at a time when public support for continued military aid is slowly dropping in the us and the 2024 election is just around the corner
former president trump is trying to sell himself as a candidate who can end the ukraine war in 24 hours while gop rival and florida gov ron desantis who announced his 2024 campaign last week has questioned continued american military support
privately the biden administration is worried about the counteroffensive failing according to politico
officials are concerned it will embolden critics who say ukraine can’t push russian forces out of its territory and anger politicians who clamored for the us to provide more weapons ahead of time such as longrange artillery and fighter jets
dashed hopes will also benefit russian president vladimir putin 
“if ukraine falls flat on its face putin will use that to say ‘there’s the evidence that we’re on the right track’” said astore from the eisenhower media network

arnold from the royal united services institute put it much less mildly
he assessed that western allies donated so much ahead of the offensive because they understood what was at stake if the offensive failsukraine’s freedom and future place in the world order 
“everything is riding on this offensive” arnold said “you don’t want to put too much pressure on them but you can’t help it”

The Senate on Thursday night capped four months of contentious debate and voted to send a compromise bill to President Biden’s desk that extends the government’s borrowing authority until January 2025 and staves off a potential default next week. 
A large bipartisan majority of the Senate voted 63-36 to approve the bill, which already passed the House on Wednesday night. 


  

The approval came after the Senate clinched an agreement to conduct a series of amendment votes Thursday night and move directly to final passage; the normally slow-moving chamber raced through a dozen votes in just over three hours.
“By passing this bill, we will avoid default tonight. America can breathe a sigh of relief,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declared on the Senate floor.  
“From the start, avoiding default has been our North Star. The consequences of default would be catastrophic,” he said. “For all the ups and downs and twists and turns it took to get here, it is so good for this country that both parties have come together at last to avoid default.” 
Senate Republican conservatives including Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) joined Republican defense hawks including Sens. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) in voting against the bill.  
A total of 31 Republicans voted against the measure, including Senate Republican Conference Committee Chairman John Barrasso (Wyo.). 
Senate Democrats, meanwhile, weren’t happy about caps on nondefense discretionary spending, tougher work requirements for federal food assistance and approval of a controversial natural gas pipeline — but the overwhelming majority of Democrats voted for the bill to avoid a default.  


  

Just four Democrats voted against the measure: Sens. John Fetterman (Pa.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), along with Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen warned congressional leaders that the federal government might run out of money June 5; if Congress didn’t raise the debt ceiling by then, it could cause an economic catastrophe. 
Biden said in a statement Thursday night he would address the country Friday and looks “forward to signing this bill into law as soon as possible.”


  

“No one gets everything they want in a negotiation, but make no mistake: This bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the American people,” he said.
The bill, which was negotiated between Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), would rescind some of the funding provided to the IRS in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act but otherwise leaves in place many of the Democratic priorities enacted in the last Congress. 
It would not impose tougher work requirements for Medicaid recipients, something Biden said was off-limits, though it would expand work requirements for food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. 


  

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) hailed the legislation as a major win for Republicans.  
“I think Speaker McCarthy should be congratulated on capturing a number of priorities,” he said, noting that Congress enacted approximately $2.7 trillion in new spending on party-line votes when Democrats were in full control in 2021 and 2022.  
“So, we’ve gone from one party spending $2.7 trillion in two years to a discussion about actually reducing government spending. So, I think the American people’s decision to change House has already yielded benefits for our country,” he said.  


  

The legislation would provide $886 billion for defense, which negotiators described as a 3-percent increase, and $637 billion for nondefense programs, according to a White House summary.  
It would rescind $28 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief funds and enact modest reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act to speed the permitting of energy projects.  
It would impose an across-the-board, 1-percent cut on discretionary spending if all 12 annual appropriations bills aren’t enacted by the end of the calendar year. 


  

But several Senate conservatives panned the bill for not cutting nearly as much off the federal deficit as advertised.  
“When I read the legislation that deals with these provisions, without fail, every one of the major provisions, the things that I thought were significant, didn’t do what they were purported to do, what they were supposed to do. And that’s concerning,” Lee told reporters.  
The Utah conservative pilloried the bill this week as a “fake response to burdensome debt” and a “victory of expediency over integrity.”  


  

Lee last week threatened to use “every procedural tool” at his disposal to impede any debt limit bill that didn’t include “substantial spending and budgetary reforms.” 
But conservatives’ appetite to drag out the debate on the bill over the weekend was dampened by the huge bipartisan vote it got in the House.  
Republican defense hawks had a different set of complaints about the legislation.  
Graham, one of several defense hawks who held the bill up for hours Thursday in an effort to extract a promise from Schumer and McConnell to safeguard defense spending, slammed the legislation for not funding additional military assistance to Ukraine.  
Graham argued the bill would actually cut the defense budget when measured against the rate of inflation.  
“I’ve heard House leaders suggest this bill fully funds the military. For that to be true, you would have to believe that the military is OK if you cut their budget $42 billion below inflation. The party of Ronald Reagan would never allow inflation to reduce defense capabilities,” he said.  
Graham teamed up with other Republican defense hawks to demand assurances from Schumer and McConnell to move the appropriations bills on time to avoid the potential of a 1 percent rescission and to move a supplemental defense spending package. 
Schumer entered into the official record two statements promising to make every effort to ensure the Pentagon will have the money it needs and to move emergency spending packages if necessary. 
“This debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the Senate’s ability to appropriate emergency supplemental funds to ensure our military capabilities are sufficient to deter China, Russia and our other adversaries,” he pledged on the Senate floor.  
Those assurances paved the way for colleagues to vote on 11 amendments to the bill and then final passage.  
All of the amendments failed; Schumer warned that any changes to the legislation would require it to be sent back to the House and put the nation perilously close to default.  
Kaine, the only Democrat to offer an amendment to the bill, failed in his attempt to strip language from the deal to expedite the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline through his home state.  
Though Schumer and McConnell were able to quell the revolt from Republican defense hawks, it’s uncertain whether they’ll be able to deliver on their promise to get all 12 appropriations bills passed by Christmas or, if necessary, a supplemental spending package to Biden’s desk. 
Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) said McCarthy didn’t sign off on the agreement between Senate leaders and defense-minded GOP senators. 
“I didn’t have conversations with him about that. I know our goal … was trying to produce a result in the Senate that would help us get an outcome that we could put on the president’s desk without sending it back to the House of Representatives,” he said.

Asked how confident he is about a defense supplemental spending bill passing later in the year, Thune said, “hard to say.” 
“It was important for some of our members have folks on the record acknowledging there clearly could be a need, will be a need, for our national security interests,” he said.

the approval came after the senate clinched an agreement to conduct a series of amendment votes thursday night and move directly to final passage the normally slowmoving chamber raced through a dozen votes in just over three hours
“by passing this bill we will avoid default tonight america can breathe a sigh of relief” senate majority leader chuck schumer dny declared on the senate floor  
“from the start avoiding default has been our north star the consequences of default would be catastrophic” he said “for all the ups and downs and twists and turns it took to get here it is so good for this country that both parties have come together at last to avoid default” 
senate republican conservatives including sens rand paul rky and mike lee rutah joined republican defense hawks including sens roger wicker rmiss lindsey graham rsc dan sullivan ralaska and tom cotton rark in voting against the bill  
a total of 31 republicans voted against the measure including senate republican conference committee chairman john barrasso wyo 
senate democrats meanwhile weren’t happy about caps on nondefense discretionary spending tougher work requirements for federal food assistance and approval of a controversial natural gas pipelinebut the overwhelming majority of democrats voted for the bill to avoid a default  


  

just four democrats voted against the measure sens john fetterman pa ed markey mass jeff merkley ore elizabeth warren mass along with bernie sanders ivt
treasury department secretary janet yellen warned congressional leaders that the federal government might run out of money june 5 if congress didn’t raise the debt ceiling by then it could cause an economic catastrophe 
biden said in a statement thursday night he would address the country friday and looks “forward to signing this bill into law as soon as possible”


  

“no one gets everything they want in a negotiation but make no mistake this bipartisan agreement is a big win for our economy and the american people” he said
the bill which was negotiated between biden and speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif would rescind some of the funding provided to the irs in last year’s inflation reduction act but otherwise leaves in place many of the democratic priorities enacted in the last congress 
it would not impose tougher work requirements for medicaid recipients something biden said was offlimits though it would expand work requirements for food stamps and temporary assistance for needy families 


  

senate republican leader mitch mcconnell ky hailed the legislation as a major win for republicans  
“i think speaker mccarthy should be congratulated on capturing a number of priorities” he said noting that congress enacted approximately 27 trillion in new spending on partyline votes when democrats were in full control in 2021 and 2022  
“so we’ve gone from one party spending 27 trillion in two years to a discussion about actually reducing government spending so i think the american people’s decision to change house has already yielded benefits for our country” he said  


  

the legislation would provide 886 billion for defense which negotiators described as a 3percent increase and 637 billion for nondefense programs according to a white house summary  
it would rescind 28 billion in unspent covid19 relief funds and enact modest reforms to the national environmental policy act to speed the permitting of energy projects  
it would impose an acrosstheboard 1percent cut on discretionary spending if all 12 annual appropriations bills aren’t enacted by the end of the calendar year 


  

but several senate conservatives panned the bill for not cutting nearly as much off the federal deficit as advertised  
“when i read the legislation that deals with these provisions without fail every one of the major provisions the things that i thought were significant didn’t do what they were purported to do what they were supposed to do and that’s concerning” lee told reporters  
the utah conservative pilloried the bill this week as a “fake response to burdensome debt” and a “victory of expediency over integrity”  


  

lee last week threatened to use “every procedural tool” at his disposal to impede any debt limit bill that didn’t include “substantial spending and budgetary reforms” 
but conservatives’ appetite to drag out the debate on the bill over the weekend was dampened by the huge bipartisan vote it got in the house  
republican defense hawks had a different set of complaints about the legislation  
graham one of several defense hawks who held the bill up for hours thursday in an effort to extract a promise from schumer and mcconnell to safeguard defense spending slammed the legislation for not funding additional military assistance to ukraine  
graham argued the bill would actually cut the defense budget when measured against the rate of inflation  
“i’ve heard house leaders suggest this bill fully funds the military for that to be true you would have to believe that the military is ok if you cut their budget 42 billion below inflation the party of ronald reagan would never allow inflation to reduce defense capabilities” he said  
graham teamed up with other republican defense hawks to demand assurances from schumer and mcconnell to move the appropriations bills on time to avoid the potential of a 1 percent rescission and to move a supplemental defense spending package 
schumer entered into the official record two statements promising to make every effort to ensure the pentagon will have the money it needs and to move emergency spending packages if necessary 
“this debt ceiling deal does nothing to limit the senate’s ability to appropriate emergency supplemental funds to ensure our military capabilities are sufficient to deter china russia and our other adversaries” he pledged on the senate floor  
those assurances paved the way for colleagues to vote on 11 amendments to the bill and then final passage  
all of the amendments failed schumer warned that any changes to the legislation would require it to be sent back to the house and put the nation perilously close to default  
kaine the only democrat to offer an amendment to the bill failed in his attempt to strip language from the deal to expedite the completion of the mountain valley pipeline through his home state  
though schumer and mcconnell were able to quell the revolt from republican defense hawks it’s uncertain whether they’ll be able to deliver on their promise to get all 12 appropriations bills passed by christmas or if necessary a supplemental spending package to biden’s desk 
senate republican whip john thune sd said mccarthy didn’t sign off on the agreement between senate leaders and defenseminded gop senators 
“i didn’t have conversations with him about that i know our goal … was trying to produce a result in the senate that would help us get an outcome that we could put on the president’s desk without sending it back to the house of representatives” he said

asked how confident he is about a defense supplemental spending bill passing later in the year thune said “hard to say” 
“it was important for some of our members have folks on the record acknowledging there clearly could be a need will be a need for our national security interests” he said

Ukraine is facing sky-high expectations ahead of its upcoming counteroffensive, raising a litany of dangers if Kyiv fails to make major advances against entrenched Russian forces.
Lackluster results could hurt Ukraine’s international support moving forward, embolden critics of continued military support and ultimately benefit Russia. 


  

Ukraine has received nearly all of the promised military aid from Western allies, including infantry fighting vehicles and main battle tanks, all of which are upping the global pressure for Ukrainians to succeed.
But victory is far from assured. 
“Sometimes, war is sold like a consumer product, where there’s a lot of hype and a lot of hope,” said Bill Astore, a retired U.S. Air Force veteran and a senior fellow with the Eisenhower Media Network. “That is contrary to the reality we often see.”
For months, messaging from Ukraine and its allies has been that Western armor, such as Germany’s Leopard tanks and American-made Stryker vehicles, are far superior to Russian equipment and will swing the war in Ukraine’s favor.
Yet Russian forces are dug in across the 600-mile front line in eastern Ukraine, and Kyiv will not have the element of surprise that helped its successful counteroffensives last year in the Kherson and Kharkiv regions.
At the same time, the counteroffensive, anticipated to stretch until the late fall, is Ukraine’s one chance this year to prove its capabilities, according to military analysts.


  

Edward Arnold, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said Ukraine is “racing against time” because the longer Russian forces remain in eastern territory, the more likely the war becomes static and occupation becomes a fait accompli.
“They don’t need to do everything, but they need to do enough for that support to continue for at least another year,” Arnold said. “They need to deliver a pretty significant play to Russian forces this year, and then it will be on Western backers to decide whether that is enough.”
The hype around the counteroffensive has been necessary to shore up support, keep troops optimistic and get the equipment and weapons needed to sustain military forces.


  

But even Ukraine has tried to temper expectations. 
Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said expectations were “definitely overheated” in a late April interview with a Ukrainian news outlet.
“Everyone wants another win,” Reznikov said, warning allies to not set expectations so high they get disappointed later. “They want the next victory. It’s normal, these are emotions.”


  

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last month his troops needed more time before launching the offensive, but analysts have assessed it has already begun and forces are probing for weaknesses in the Russian lines.
Allies are anticipating big territorial gains, including the hope Ukraine will strike in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region and cut off a land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014 and serves as a major supply hub for Russian troops. Other significant territorial gains are expected in the Luhansk or Donetsk regions, which make up the eastern Donbas.
But satellite images have shown entrenched Russian troops all across the front, particularly around Crimea and the Zaporizhzhia region.


  

The tranche of vehicles and advanced weapons provided by Western allies was donated in part with the expectation that Ukraine could use it in a strategy of combined arms maneuver warfare.
In that military tactic, Ukrainians would work in sync with aircraft, vehicular armor and infantry to break through Russia’s fortifications, which — if done correctly — would put already-struggling Russian forces on their backfoot.
But combined arms maneuvers are difficult to pull off, require extensive training and even the best armies can sometimes fail to coordinate properly, according to experts.


  

Last month, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. has done “everything we can” to supply Ukraine with the capabilities to succeed, but he stopped short of saying he was confident in a Ukrainian victory.
“It’s not just the stuff, it’s the know-how and how to use that stuff in the field,” Kirby said at a press briefing. “As for the actual execution of any kind of spring counteroffensive, that’s going to be up to President Zelensky.”
Military analysts expect Ukraine to succeed in breaking through Russian lines in some places, but it’s less clear when that will happen and how dramatic of a punch it will be.


  

Instead of defining success along the lines of huge territorial gains, Western allies should look at any breakthrough of Russian lines as a victory, said Hein Goemans, the director of the Peter D. Watson Center for Conflict and Cooperation at the University of Rochester.
“That’s still showing that you won’t be tied down in the war of attrition because you have achieved a breakthrough and you can do that elsewhere,” Goemans said. “If you show that you can do this consistently, then you will force [allies] to change their expectations, and that’s what we need.”
Still, those marginal wins are unlikely to pull dramatic headlines at a time when public support for continued military aid is slowly dropping in the U.S. and the 2024 election is just around the corner.
Former President Trump is trying to sell himself as a candidate who can end the Ukraine war in 24 hours, while GOP rival and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who announced his 2024 campaign last week, has questioned continued American military support.
Privately, the Biden administration is worried about the counteroffensive failing, according to Politico.
Officials are concerned it will embolden critics who say Ukraine can’t push Russian forces out of its territory and anger politicians who clamored for the U.S. to provide more weapons ahead of time, such as long-range artillery and fighter jets.
Dashed hopes will also benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
“If Ukraine falls flat on its face, Putin will use that to say, ‘There’s the evidence that we’re on the right track,’” said Astore from the Eisenhower Media Network.

Arnold, from the Royal United Services Institute, put it much less mildly.
He assessed that Western allies donated so much ahead of the offensive because they understood what was at stake if the offensive fails — Ukraine’s freedom and future place in the world order. 
“Everything is riding on this offensive,” Arnold said. “You don’t want to put too much pressure on them, [but] you can’t help it.”

Dual revelations about Jack Smith’s probe into the mishandling of records at Mar-a-Lago suggest the special counsel’s probe into former President Trump is advancing on several fronts, bolstering the case against him.
Reporting from CNN this week indicates authorities have a recording of Trump discussing his inability to share the contents of a classified document he retained — undercutting his long-standing claim he declassified the records in his possession.


  

The special counsel is also seeking more information about the movement of boxes at the Mar-a-Lago carried out by two Trump employees, The Washington Post reported, while Trump attorney Evan Corcoran was waived off from searching certain portions of Trump’s Florida home following a subpoena, according to The Guardian. 
Collectively, the reporting suggests the special counsel is buttressing Espionage Act charges over the episode and still building an obstruction of justice case over the ensuing saga to secure the return of the records.
The week was capped with a report from lawyers and former prosecutors who concluded, based on public reporting, that the DOJ has enough evidence in the case to merit charging Trump directly.
“The Department’s own precedent makes clear that charging Trump would be to treat him comparably to others who engaged in similar criminal behavior, often with far fewer aggravating factors than the former president. Based on the publicly available information to date, a powerful case exists for charging Trump,” the group wrote in a model prosecution memo published by Just Security. 
“We conclude that Trump should — and likely will — be charged.”
The tapes, which have not been directly reviewed by any outlet and only described by sources familiar, capture Trump in summer 2021 discussing a classified document reviewing options for launching a possible attack on Iran. 


  

In a short segment of a longer discussion, taped in preparation for a book on Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Trump apparently suggests he would like to show them the document but can’t, given constraints on his ability to declassify documents after leaving office.
The tape is significant on two counts. It undercuts Trump’s ongoing claim that he declassified the records found at his home, something he at one point claimed a president could do simply by thinking about it.
But it also shows Trump’s awareness of the rules and processes surrounding the classification process ahead of the special counsel’s investigation, a key detail for prosecutors who would need to successfully demonstrate the former president willfully retained the records.


  

“The tape recording is most probative of Trump’s mental state. It shows that he knew the documents remained classified and shouldn’t be shared with others, which further undercuts any potential argument that he secretly declassified them,” Brian Greer, a former CIA attorney, told The Hill. 
“It also makes it much easier to demonstrate that Trump’s retention of the documents was willful, a key element of an Espionage Act charge.”
Jim Trusty, an attorney for Trump, wouldn’t comment on whether the document in question was classified — saying during an appearance on CNN that Trump has “unfettered authority” to both declassify and personalize records from his presidency. 


  

Trump, in a Thursday night interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity, also defended his actions without getting into specifics.
“All I know is this — everything I did was right. We have the Presidential Records Act, which I abided by a hundred percent,” Trump said.
Prosecution under the Espionage Act doesn’t require that information be classified, just that it deals with information important to the national defense. Plans for responding to Iran would likely qualify.


  

Part of the power of the tape is it allows prosecutors to hear in Trump’s voice his awareness of the rules surrounding the handling of sensitive information.
“If it is accurate as reported, I do think it’s very powerful evidence. One, it proves Donald Trump’s knowledge about the law regarding the handling of classified information. Unlike most laws, where ignorance of the law is no excuse, there are some exceptions to that law and one of them is handling classified information. You do have to know that it’s illegal when you violate that law,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney.
“Having Trump on tape talking about, ‘I wish I could talk about this, but I can’t because it’s classified and I should have declassified it before I left,’ — that’s pretty good evidence of his knowledge.”


  

Other developments in the case show the DOJ continues to actively pursue evidence that could lead to an obstruction of justice charge.
Justice Department officials recently questioned a second Trump aide who was seen on camera helping Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, in moving boxes at Mar-a-Lago, including the day before DOJ officials came to collect classified material in June following a subpoena. 
They’ve since asked additional questions about actions taken in July, when the DOJ issued a subpoena for video camera footage at Mar-a-Lago. That tape has been reported to have gaps, and the Justice Department recently spoke with two Trump Organization security officials about the matter. 


  

In the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, authorities said they had evidence of “obstructive conduct” and said that items “were likely concealed and removed from the storage room.”
Prosecutors also have at their disposal detailed notes from Corcoran, who removed himself from the Mar-a-Lago case after a judge pierced attorney-client privilege in the matter after determining that Trump may have misled him.
Judges have the power to strip the privilege if they believe legal advice has been used in furtherance of a crime. 
Corcoran reportedly told authorities he was waved off of searching Trump’s office, where numerous classified records were found during the execution of the search warrant, and he said he was told any classified records would be found in the storage room with the records from Trump’s presidency. It’s unclear who waved him off.
Corcoran turned over 38 classified records in June in response to the subpoena, while the FBI found a little more than 100 more during their August search.

McQuade said building the case will involve painting a picture for jurors breaking down the timeline of moving the boxes and other actions taken amid various DOJ and Archives entreaties seeking the return of the documents. 
“You do have to find statements and actions from which you can argue to a jury that we can infer the person’s intent,” she said, offering the example, “‘This was not an innocent movement of boxes. When they returned a small envelope and it actually turned out that they had 26 boxes, now that was not an oversight. When Corcoran was waved away from Trump’s office, that was not an innocent mistake.’” 
“You know, if you can pile up enough of those at some point … the evidence becomes so overwhelming.”

dual revelations about jack smith’s probe into the mishandling of records at maralago suggest the special counsel’s probe into former president trump is advancing on several fronts bolstering the case against him
reporting from  this week indicates authorities have a recording of trump discussing his inability to share the contents of a classified document he retainedundercutting his longstanding claim he declassified the records in his possession


  

the special counsel is also seeking more information about the movement of boxes at the maralago carried out by two trump employees the washington post reported while trump attorney evan corcoran was waived off from searching certain portions of trump’s florida home following a subpoena according to the guardian 
collectively the reporting suggests the special counsel is buttressing espionage act charges over the episode and still building an obstruction of justice case over the ensuing saga to secure the return of the records
the week was capped with a report from lawyers and former prosecutors who concluded based on public reporting that the doj has enough evidence in the case to merit charging trump directly
“the department’s own precedent makes clear that charging trump would be to treat him comparably to others who engaged in similar criminal behavior often with far fewer aggravating factors than the former president based on the publicly available information to date a powerful case exists for charging trump” the group wrote in a model prosecution memo published by just security 
“we conclude that trump shouldand likely willbe charged”
the tapes which have not been directly reviewed by any outlet and only described by sources familiar capture trump in summer 2021 discussing a classified document reviewing options for launching a possible attack on iran 


  

in a short segment of a longer discussion taped in preparation for a book on trump’s chief of staff mark meadows trump apparently suggests he would like to show them the document but can’t given constraints on his ability to declassify documents after leaving office
the tape is significant on two counts it undercuts trump’s ongoing claim that he declassified the records found at his home something he at one point claimed a president could do simply by thinking about it
but it also shows trump’s awareness of the rules and processes surrounding the classification process ahead of the special counsel’s investigation a key detail for prosecutors who would need to successfully demonstrate the former president willfully retained the records


  

“the tape recording is most probative of trump’s mental state it shows that he knew the documents remained classified and shouldn’t be shared with others which further undercuts any potential argument that he secretly declassified them” brian greer a former cia attorney told the hill 
“it also makes it much easier to demonstrate that trump’s retention of the documents was willful a key element of an espionage act charge”
jim trusty an attorney for trump wouldn’t comment on whether the document in question was classifiedsaying during an appearance on  that trump has “unfettered authority” to both declassify and personalize records from his presidency 


  

trump in a thursday night interview with ’s sean hannity also defended his actions without getting into specifics
“all i know is thiseverything i did was right we have the presidential records act which i abided by a hundred percent” trump said
prosecution under the espionage act doesn’t require that information be classified just that it deals with information important to the national defense plans for responding to iran would likely qualify


  

part of the power of the tape is it allows prosecutors to hear in trump’s voice his awareness of the rules surrounding the handling of sensitive information
“if it is accurate as reported i do think it’s very powerful evidence one it proves donald trump’s knowledge about the law regarding the handling of classified information unlike most laws where ignorance of the law is no excuse there are some exceptions to that law and one of them is handling classified information you do have to know that it’s illegal when you violate that law” said barbara mcquade a former us attorney
“having trump on tape talking about ‘i wish i could talk about this but i can’t because it’s classified and i should have declassified it before i left’that’s pretty good evidence of his knowledge”


  

other developments in the case show the doj continues to actively pursue evidence that could lead to an obstruction of justice charge
justice department officials recently questioned a second trump aide who was seen on camera helping trump’s valet walt nauta in moving boxes at maralago including the day before doj officials came to collect classified material in june following a subpoena 
they’ve since asked additional questions about actions taken in july when the doj issued a subpoena for video camera footage at maralago that tape has been reported to have gaps and the justice department recently spoke with two trump organization security officials about the matter 


  

in the warrant to search maralago authorities said they had evidence of “obstructive conduct” and said that items “were likely concealed and removed from the storage room”
prosecutors also have at their disposal detailed notes from corcoran who removed himself from the maralago case after a judge pierced attorneyclient privilege in the matter after determining that trump may have misled him
judges have the power to strip the privilege if they believe legal advice has been used in furtherance of a crime 
corcoran reportedly told authorities he was waved off of searching trump’s office where numerous classified records were found during the execution of the search warrant and he said he was told any classified records would be found in the storage room with the records from trump’s presidency it’s unclear who waved him off
corcoran turned over 38 classified records in june in response to the subpoena while the fbi found a little more than 100 more during their august search

A Texas federal judge has banned legal filings that are drafted primarily by artificial intelligence (AI) in his court without a person first checking those documents for accuracy. 
U.S. District Judge Brantley Starr ordered that attorneys file a certificate before appearing before the court that either AI platforms did not contribute to any part of a filing or that someone checked any language that it drafted for accuracy using print reporters or traditional legal databases. 


  

“These platforms are incredibly powerful and have many uses in the law: form divorces, discovery requests, suggested errors in documents, anticipated questions at oral argument,”  a post on Starr’s page on the Northern District of Texas court website states. “But legal briefing is not one of them.”
Starr argued that the AI platforms like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard are “prone to hallucinations and bias.” He said they can make up content like quotes or citations and can only follow the code that they are programmed with instead of upholding the law and ethics. 
“As such, these systems hold no allegiance to any client, the rule of law, or the laws and Constitution of the United States (or, as addressed above, the truth),” he said in the post. “Unbound by any sense of duty, honor, or justice, such programs act according to computer code rather than conviction, based on programming rather than principle.” 
Any filing from a party that does not submit the certification will be stricken. 
CBS News reported that the order came after a lawyer used ChatGPT to produce a filing in a lawsuit, but the platform made up court cases that did not exist and referenced them in its argument.

AI platforms have become increasingly popular in recent months with several Big Tech companies vowing to develop their own versions. But some detractors have warned that advancements in AI technology could come at significant cost — such as increasing the spread of propaganda and replacing manual jobs with automated ones. 


  

A group of AI experts and industry leaders warned in an open letter earlier this week that mitigating the risk of “extinction” from AI should be as much a global priority as preventing pandemics and nuclear war. 
Major technology experts — including Twitter CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak — also called for at least a six-month pause on the development of AI technology in March until society can be sure that it can manage the risks.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — While judges, lawyers and support staff at the federal courthouse in Concord, New Hampshire, keep the American justice system buzzing, thousands of humble honeybees on the building’s roof are playing their part in a more important task — feeding the world.
The Warren B. Rudman courthouse is one of several federal facilities around the country participating in the General Services Administration’s Pollinator Initiative, a government program aimed at assessing and promoting the health of bees and other pollinators, which are critical to life on Earth.


  

“Anybody who eats food needs bees,” said Noah Wilson-Rich, co-founder, CEO and chief scientific officer of the Boston-based Best Bees company, which contracts with the government to take care of the honeybee hives at the New Hampshire courthouse and at some other federal buildings.
Bees help pollinate the fruits and vegetables that sustain humans, he said. They pollinate hay and alfalfa, which feed cattle that provide the meat we eat. And they promote the health of plants that, through photosynthesis, give us clean air to breathe.
Yet the busy insects that contribute an estimated $25 billion to the U.S. economy annually are under threat from diseases, agricultural chemicals and habitat loss that kill about half of all honeybee hives annually. Without human intervention, including beekeepers creating new hives, the world could experience a bee extinction that would lead to global hunger and economic collapse, Wilson-Rich said.
The pollinator program is part of the federal government’s commitment to promoting sustainability, which includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting climate resilient infrastructure, said David Johnson, the General Services Administration’s sustainability program manager for New England.
The administration’s program started last year with hives at 11 sites.
Some of those sites are no longer in the program. Hives placed at the National Archives building in Waltham, Massachusetts, last year did not survive the winter.


  

Since then, other sites were added. Two hives, each home to thousands of bees, were placed on the roof of the Rudman building in March.
The program is collecting data to find out whether the honeybees, which can fly 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 kilometers) from the roof in their quest for pollen, can help the health of not just the plants on the roof, but also of the flora in the entire area, Johnson said.
“Honeybees are actually very opportunistic,” he said. “They will feed on a lot of different types of plants.”


  

The program can help identify the plants and landscapes beneficial to pollinators and help the government make more informed decisions about what trees and flowers to plant on building grounds.
Best Bees tests the plant DNA in the honey to get an idea of the plant diversity and health in the area, Wilson-Rich said, and they have found that bees that forage on a more diverse diet seem to have better survival and productivity outcomes.
Other federal facilities with hives include the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services headquarters in Baltimore; the federal courthouse in Hammond, Indiana; the Federal Archives Records Center in Chicago; and the Denver Federal Center.


  

The federal government isn’t alone in its efforts to save the bees. The hives placed at federal sites are part of a wider network of about 1,000 hives at home gardens, businesses and institutions nationwide that combined can help determine what’s helping the bees, what’s hurting them and why.
The General Services Administration’s Pollinator Initiative is also looking to identify ways to keep the bee population healthy and vibrant and model those lessons at other properties — both government and private sector — said Amber Levofsky, the senior program advisor for the administration’s Center for Urban Development.

concord nh apwhile judges lawyers and support staff at the federal courthouse in concord new hampshire keep the american justice system buzzing thousands of humble honeybees on the building’s roof are playing their part in a more important taskfeeding the world
the warren b rudman courthouse is one of several federal facilities around the country participating in the general services administration’s pollinator initiative a government program aimed at assessing and promoting the health of bees and other pollinators which are critical to life on earth


  

“anybody who eats food needs bees” said noah wilsonrich cofounder ceo and chief scientific officer of the bostonbased best bees company which contracts with the government to take care of the honeybee hives at the new hampshire courthouse and at some other federal buildings
bees help pollinate the fruits and vegetables that sustain humans he said they pollinate hay and alfalfa which feed cattle that provide the meat we eat and they promote the health of plants that through photosynthesis give us clean air to breathe
yet the busy insects that contribute an estimated 25 billion to the us economy annually are under threat from diseases agricultural chemicals and habitat loss that kill about half of all honeybee hives annually without human intervention including beekeepers creating new hives the world could experience a bee extinction that would lead to global hunger and economic collapse wilsonrich said
the pollinator program is part of the federal government’s commitment to promoting sustainability which includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting climate resilient infrastructure said david johnson the general services administration’s sustainability program manager for new england
the administration’s program started last year with hives at 11 sites
some of those sites are no longer in the program hives placed at the national archives building in waltham massachusetts last year did not survive the winter


  

since then other sites were added two hives each home to thousands of bees were placed on the roof of the rudman building in march
the program is collecting data to find out whether the honeybees which can fly 3 to 5 miles 5 to 8 kilometers from the roof in their quest for pollen can help the health of not just the plants on the roof but also of the flora in the entire area johnson said
“honeybees are actually very opportunistic” he said “they will feed on a lot of different types of plants”


  

the program can help identify the plants and landscapes beneficial to pollinators and help the government make more informed decisions about what trees and flowers to plant on building grounds
best bees tests the plant dna in the honey to get an idea of the plant diversity and health in the area wilsonrich said and they have found that bees that forage on a more diverse diet seem to have better survival and productivity outcomes
other federal facilities with hives include the centers for medicare and medicaid services headquarters in baltimore the federal courthouse in hammond indiana the federal archives records center in chicago and the denver federal center


  

the federal government isn’t alone in its efforts to save the bees the hives placed at federal sites are part of a wider network of about 1000 hives at home gardens businesses and institutions nationwide that combined can help determine what’s helping the bees what’s hurting them and why
the general services administration’s pollinator initiative is also looking to identify ways to keep the bee population healthy and vibrant and model those lessons at other propertiesboth government and private sectorsaid amber levofsky the senior program advisor for the administration’s center for urban development
“the goal of this initiative was really aimed at gathering locationbased data at facilities to help update directives and policies to help facilities managers to really target pollinator protection and habitat management regionally” she said

Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is not “interested in facilitating or listening” to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is expected to launch a bid for the 2024 GOP nomination for president Tuesday. 
Hannity said Friday that he does not have any problem with giving airtime to any of the candidates who want to come on his show to give their point of view on the issues, but he believes Christie is more interested in attacking Trump than winning the nomination. 


  

“I’m looking at this and I’m saying, ‘OK, you’re only getting in this race ’cause you hate Donald Trump and want to bludgeon Donald Trump.’ I don’t see Chris Christie actually wanting to run and win the nomination. He views it as his role to be the enforcer and to attack Trump,” Hannity said. 
Christie was formerly a close ally of Trump and helped him prepare for the 2020 presidential debates against President Biden. But Christie soured on Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and broader efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 
Christie has lobbed strong criticism on Trump in the years since. 
He has also been among the sharpest critics of the current and potential Republican candidates for the nomination against Trump, saying last month that that the only way to win is to “go through” the former president. 
Christie also has said he does not believe that Republican voters will punish a candidate for attacking Trump, dismissing a fear that some experts and observers believe is widespread among Republicans. 
“You know what? That’s not a very inspiring agenda, and I don’t even know if I’m interested in facilitating or listening to him babble on when he left office with nobody in New Jersey even liking him,” Hannity said, referring to Christie’s low approval ratings from his time as governor.

Christie served two terms as governor in a state that strongly leans Democratic, but he had one of the lowest approval ratings of any governor in state history by the time he left office in 2018. 
A Quinnipiac University poll taken in June 2017 found his approval rating to be 15 percent, the lowest of any governor in recorded New Jersey history. 
Christie previously ran for president in 2016 but dropped out following the New Hampshire primary.

Several Republican presidential hopefuls slammed former President Trump for his comments praising North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday in which he congratulated him for his country receiving a seat on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) executive board.
Former Vice President Mike Pence, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis all criticized the former president, who offered his congratulations to Kim in a Truth Social post on Friday.


  

“No one should be praising the dictator in North Korea or praising the leader of Russia who has launched an unprovoked war of aggression in Ukraine,” Pence told Fox News while in Iowa on Saturday. “This is a time when we ought to make it clear to the world that we stand for freedom and we stand with those who stand for freedom.”
The former Indiana governor also attacked the WHO, claiming it “let America and the world down” during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I mean, they literally were complicitous in covering up what was happening in China, and we held them to account during our administration.”
Pence is expected to launch his campaign for the 2024 Republican nomination next week, after months of hinting at a potential White House run.
Haley denounced North Korea’s ascension ascension to the WHO board Friday, calling it a “total farce.” 
“You don’t congratulate a thug,” she added Saturday, when asked about Trump’s comment. “I mean, let’s keep in mind, this thug [Kim] has threatened America, has threatened our allies, over and over again.” 


  

“This is not something to play with,” Haley continued. “I mean, he’s a terrible individual. He’s terrible to his people, he’s terrible to our allies in the world, and I don’t think he deserves congratulations.”
DeSantis, who officially joined the Republican field late last month during a glitch-ridden Twitter Spaces event, said he was “surprised” to see Trump’s congratulations to Kim, whom he described as a “murderous dictator.”
All three were in Des Moines on Saturday for Sen. Joni Ernst’s (R-Iowa) annual Roast and Ride fundraiser.

Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, another GOP hopeful who attended the event, echoed the sentiments of his challengers in a post on Twitter.
“Kim Jong-Un, the tyrant dictator in North Korea should not be praised by Donald Trump for a leadership role in the World Health Organization,” Hutchinson wrote. “We sanction leaders who oppress their people. We do not elevate them on the world stage.”
Trump has previously touted his relationship with Kim, telling Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward that the two had “good chemistry.” He also exchanged what he called “love letters” with the North Korean leader.

Dual revelations about Jack Smith’s probe into the mishandling of records at Mar-a-Lago suggest the special counsel’s probe into former President Trump is advancing on several fronts, bolstering the case against him.
Reporting from CNN this week indicates authorities have a recording of Trump discussing his inability to share the contents of a classified document he retained — undercutting his long-standing claim he declassified the records in his possession.


  

The special counsel is also seeking more information about the movement of boxes at the Mar-a-Lago carried out by two Trump employees, The Washington Post reported, while Trump attorney Evan Corcoran was waived off from searching certain portions of Trump’s Florida home following a subpoena, according to The Guardian. 
Collectively, the reporting suggests the special counsel is buttressing Espionage Act charges over the episode and still building an obstruction of justice case over the ensuing saga to secure the return of the records.
The week was capped with a report from lawyers and former prosecutors who concluded, based on public reporting, that the DOJ has enough evidence in the case to merit charging Trump directly.
“The Department’s own precedent makes clear that charging Trump would be to treat him comparably to others who engaged in similar criminal behavior, often with far fewer aggravating factors than the former president. Based on the publicly available information to date, a powerful case exists for charging Trump,” the group wrote in a model prosecution memo published by Just Security. 
“We conclude that Trump should — and likely will — be charged.”
The tapes, which have not been directly reviewed by any outlet and only described by sources familiar, capture Trump in summer 2021 discussing a classified document reviewing options for launching a possible attack on Iran. 


  

In a short segment of a longer discussion, taped in preparation for a book on Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Trump apparently suggests he would like to show them the document but can’t, given constraints on his ability to declassify documents after leaving office.
The tape is significant on two counts. It undercuts Trump’s ongoing claim that he declassified the records found at his home, something he at one point claimed a president could do simply by thinking about it.
But it also shows Trump’s awareness of the rules and processes surrounding the classification process ahead of the special counsel’s investigation, a key detail for prosecutors who would need to successfully demonstrate the former president willfully retained the records.


  

“The tape recording is most probative of Trump’s mental state. It shows that he knew the documents remained classified and shouldn’t be shared with others, which further undercuts any potential argument that he secretly declassified them,” Brian Greer, a former CIA attorney, told The Hill. 
“It also makes it much easier to demonstrate that Trump’s retention of the documents was willful, a key element of an Espionage Act charge.”
Jim Trusty, an attorney for Trump, wouldn’t comment on whether the document in question was classified — saying during an appearance on CNN that Trump has “unfettered authority” to both declassify and personalize records from his presidency. 


  

Trump, in a Thursday night interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity, also defended his actions without getting into specifics.
“All I know is this — everything I did was right. We have the Presidential Records Act, which I abided by a hundred percent,” Trump said.
Prosecution under the Espionage Act doesn’t require that information be classified, just that it deals with information important to the national defense. Plans for responding to Iran would likely qualify.


  

Part of the power of the tape is it allows prosecutors to hear in Trump’s voice his awareness of the rules surrounding the handling of sensitive information.
“If it is accurate as reported, I do think it’s very powerful evidence. One, it proves Donald Trump’s knowledge about the law regarding the handling of classified information. Unlike most laws, where ignorance of the law is no excuse, there are some exceptions to that law and one of them is handling classified information. You do have to know that it’s illegal when you violate that law,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney.
“Having Trump on tape talking about, ‘I wish I could talk about this, but I can’t because it’s classified and I should have declassified it before I left,’ — that’s pretty good evidence of his knowledge.”


  

Other developments in the case show the DOJ continues to actively pursue evidence that could lead to an obstruction of justice charge.
Justice Department officials recently questioned a second Trump aide who was seen on camera helping Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, in moving boxes at Mar-a-Lago, including the day before DOJ officials came to collect classified material in June following a subpoena. 
They’ve since asked additional questions about actions taken in July, when the DOJ issued a subpoena for video camera footage at Mar-a-Lago. That tape has been reported to have gaps, and the Justice Department recently spoke with two Trump Organization security officials about the matter. 


  

In the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, authorities said they had evidence of “obstructive conduct” and said that items “were likely concealed and removed from the storage room.”
Prosecutors also have at their disposal detailed notes from Corcoran, who removed himself from the Mar-a-Lago case after a judge pierced attorney-client privilege in the matter after determining that Trump may have misled him.
Judges have the power to strip the privilege if they believe legal advice has been used in furtherance of a crime. 
Corcoran reportedly told authorities he was waved off of searching Trump’s office, where numerous classified records were found during the execution of the search warrant, and he said he was told any classified records would be found in the storage room with the records from Trump’s presidency. It’s unclear who waved him off.
Corcoran turned over 38 classified records in June in response to the subpoena, while the FBI found a little more than 100 more during their August search.

McQuade said building the case will involve painting a picture for jurors breaking down the timeline of moving the boxes and other actions taken amid various DOJ and Archives entreaties seeking the return of the documents. 
“You do have to find statements and actions from which you can argue to a jury that we can infer the person’s intent,” she said, offering the example, “‘This was not an innocent movement of boxes. When they returned a small envelope and it actually turned out that they had 26 boxes, now that was not an oversight. When Corcoran was waved away from Trump’s office, that was not an innocent mistake.’” 
“You know, if you can pile up enough of those at some point … the evidence becomes so overwhelming.”

dual revelations about jack smith’s probe into the mishandling of records at maralago suggest the special counsel’s probe into former president trump is advancing on several fronts bolstering the case against him
reporting from  this week indicates authorities have a recording of trump discussing his inability to share the contents of a classified document he retainedundercutting his longstanding claim he declassified the records in his possession


  

the special counsel is also seeking more information about the movement of boxes at the maralago carried out by two trump employees the washington post reported while trump attorney evan corcoran was waived off from searching certain portions of trump’s florida home following a subpoena according to the guardian 
collectively the reporting suggests the special counsel is buttressing espionage act charges over the episode and still building an obstruction of justice case over the ensuing saga to secure the return of the records
the week was capped with a report from lawyers and former prosecutors who concluded based on public reporting that the doj has enough evidence in the case to merit charging trump directly
“the department’s own precedent makes clear that charging trump would be to treat him comparably to others who engaged in similar criminal behavior often with far fewer aggravating factors than the former president based on the publicly available information to date a powerful case exists for charging trump” the group wrote in a model prosecution memo published by just security 
“we conclude that trump shouldand likely willbe charged”
the tapes which have not been directly reviewed by any outlet and only described by sources familiar capture trump in summer 2021 discussing a classified document reviewing options for launching a possible attack on iran 


  

in a short segment of a longer discussion taped in preparation for a book on trump’s chief of staff mark meadows trump apparently suggests he would like to show them the document but can’t given constraints on his ability to declassify documents after leaving office
the tape is significant on two counts it undercuts trump’s ongoing claim that he declassified the records found at his home something he at one point claimed a president could do simply by thinking about it
but it also shows trump’s awareness of the rules and processes surrounding the classification process ahead of the special counsel’s investigation a key detail for prosecutors who would need to successfully demonstrate the former president willfully retained the records


  

“the tape recording is most probative of trump’s mental state it shows that he knew the documents remained classified and shouldn’t be shared with others which further undercuts any potential argument that he secretly declassified them” brian greer a former cia attorney told the hill 
“it also makes it much easier to demonstrate that trump’s retention of the documents was willful a key element of an espionage act charge”
jim trusty an attorney for trump wouldn’t comment on whether the document in question was classifiedsaying during an appearance on  that trump has “unfettered authority” to both declassify and personalize records from his presidency 


  

trump in a thursday night interview with ’s sean hannity also defended his actions without getting into specifics
“all i know is thiseverything i did was right we have the presidential records act which i abided by a hundred percent” trump said
prosecution under the espionage act doesn’t require that information be classified just that it deals with information important to the national defense plans for responding to iran would likely qualify


  

part of the power of the tape is it allows prosecutors to hear in trump’s voice his awareness of the rules surrounding the handling of sensitive information
“if it is accurate as reported i do think it’s very powerful evidence one it proves donald trump’s knowledge about the law regarding the handling of classified information unlike most laws where ignorance of the law is no excuse there are some exceptions to that law and one of them is handling classified information you do have to know that it’s illegal when you violate that law” said barbara mcquade a former us attorney
“having trump on tape talking about ‘i wish i could talk about this but i can’t because it’s classified and i should have declassified it before i left’that’s pretty good evidence of his knowledge”


  

other developments in the case show the doj continues to actively pursue evidence that could lead to an obstruction of justice charge
justice department officials recently questioned a second trump aide who was seen on camera helping trump’s valet walt nauta in moving boxes at maralago including the day before doj officials came to collect classified material in june following a subpoena 
they’ve since asked additional questions about actions taken in july when the doj issued a subpoena for video camera footage at maralago that tape has been reported to have gaps and the justice department recently spoke with two trump organization security officials about the matter 


  

in the warrant to search maralago authorities said they had evidence of “obstructive conduct” and said that items “were likely concealed and removed from the storage room”
prosecutors also have at their disposal detailed notes from corcoran who removed himself from the maralago case after a judge pierced attorneyclient privilege in the matter after determining that trump may have misled him
judges have the power to strip the privilege if they believe legal advice has been used in furtherance of a crime 
corcoran reportedly told authorities he was waved off of searching trump’s office where numerous classified records were found during the execution of the search warrant and he said he was told any classified records would be found in the storage room with the records from trump’s presidency it’s unclear who waved him off
corcoran turned over 38 classified records in june in response to the subpoena while the fbi found a little more than 100 more during their august search

Former FBI Director James Comey predicted on Sunday that former President Trump “could be wearing an ankle bracelet” when accepting the GOP nomination if he wins it in 2024, as the former president faces a number of legal challenges.
Comey said on MSNBC’s “Inside with Jen Psaki” that he doesn’t “want to” but “could” envision Trump getting the Republican nod. 


  

“I mean, it’s this crazy world that Donald Trump has dragged this country into, but he could be wearing an ankle bracelet while accepting the nomination at the Republican convention,” Comey said.
“You would be rejected if you put it in a script for a show, but you could have a president who is potentially incarcerated when he is elected president,” he added.
Trump if facing a slew of legal woes including an indicted on criminal charges in New York, and two Justice Department inquiries led by special counsel Jack Smith. A Georgia prosecutor is probing attempts to overturn the state’s election results in 2020, and Trump was also found liable last month for sexual abuse and defamation writer E. Jean Carroll. 
As he runs for another term in the White House, Trump has said he won’t drop out of the 2024 race for any legal reason. He’s still legally able to lodge his campaign even as he faces charges and the other ongoing legal battles.
Trump fired Comey as FBI director during his tenure at the White House in May 2017. Trump cited Comey’s handling of an investigation involving an email server belonging the Hillary Clinton while she was running as Trump’s opponent in the 2016 election even though it benefitted him politically.

Trump ultimately let Comey go over investigations involving Russia and Trump’s aides though Comey had informed Trump that he himself was not being probed.


  

Comey on Sunday said where a potential 2024 GOP nomination of Trump could lead is unknown.
“So, that would be weird and awkward. And it seems even crazy to be coming out of my mouth, but that’s the situation we face. It looks like the Republicans will likely nominate someone who is under serious criminal investigation, is indicted, and who knows where that’s going to lead us,” Comey said.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Debate surrounding Florida’s new restrictions on gender-affirming care focused largely on transgender children. But a new law that Republican presidential candidate and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed last month also made it difficult – even impossible – for many transgender adults to get treatment.
Eli and Lucas, trans men who are a couple, followed the discussions in the Legislature, where Democrats warned that trans children would be more prone to suicide under a ban on gender-affirming care for minors and Republicans responded with misplaced tales of mutilated kids. Eli said he and his partner felt “blindsided” when they discovered the bill contained language that would also disrupt their lives.


  

“There was no communication. … Nobody was really talking about it in our circles,” said Eli, 29.
Like many transgender adults in Florida, he and Lucas are now facing tough choices, including whether to uproot their lives so that they can continue to access gender-confirming care. Clinics are also trying to figure out how to operate under regulations that have made Florida a test case for restrictions on adults.
Lucas, 26, lost his access to treatment when the Orlando clinic that prescribed him hormone replacement therapy stopped providing gender-affirming care altogether. The couple also worries about staying in a state that this year enacted several other bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community.
“My entire life is here. All my friends, my family. I just got a promotion at my job, which I’m probably not to be able to keep,” Lucas, who works in a financial aid office at a college, said. “I’m losing everything except Eli and my pets moving out of here. So this was not a decision that I took lightly at all.”
The Associated Press is not using Eli’s and Lucas’ last names because they fear reprisal. While their friends and families know they are trans, most people who meet them do not.
The new law that bans gender-affirming care for minors also mandates that adult patients seeking trans health care sign an informed consent form. It also requires a physician to oversee any health care related to transitioning, and for people to see that doctor in person. Those rules have proven particularly onerous because many people received care from nurse practitioners and used telehealth. The law also made it a crime to violate the new requirements.


  

Another new law that allows doctors and pharmacists to refuse to treat transgender people further limits their options.
“For trans adults, it’s devastating,” said Kate Steinle, chief clinical officer at FOLX Health, which provides gender-affirming care to trans adults through telemedicine. Her company decided to open in-person clinics and hire more physicians licensed in Florida in order to continue to provide care to patients who have already enrolled, even though that represents a major change to the company’s business model.
Eli has been seeing a physician for years and therefore still has access to care. But SPEKTRUM Health Inc., the Orlando clinic that prescribed Lucas hormone replacement therapy, has stopped providing gender-affirming care.


  

“There are a lot of people looking for care that we’re no longer legally able to provide,” said Lana Dunn, SPEKTRUM Health’s chief operating officer. 
Florida has the second-largest population of transgender adults in the U.S., at an estimated 94,900 people, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. It used state-level, population-based surveys to determine its estimates. Not all transgender people seek medical interventions.
At least 19 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. But restrictions on adults haven’t been part of the conversation in most places. Missouri’s attorney general tried to impose a rule in that state, but it was pulled back.


  

Florida is “the proving ground of what they can get away with,” Dunn said.
Her organization treats about 4,000 people — most in Florida and some out-of-state telehealth patients, she said. While SPEKTRUM has bolstered its mental health services since the law passed, it and other organizations heavily rely on nurse practitioners to provide care.
Dunn estimates that 80% of trans adults in the state were getting their health care from a nurse practitioner and now have lost access.


  

“Right now what we’re seeing in the community is just chaos,” Dunn said.
The law also contains language that she said could scare off doctors who would be otherwise willing to treat trans patients, such as a 20-year statute of limitations to sue over care they provide.
As a trans woman herself, Dunn is grappling with losing her own access to hormones while trying to provide support to terrified patients. That’s taken “a significant emotional toll,” she said.


  

“Not only am I faced with this lack of care for myself but a lot of people within the community are also facing the same thing, and they’re reaching out to me for guidance,” Dunn said. “So I’m doing my best to help guide people and console them, but nobody’s really reaching out to me saying, ’How are you doing? Are you OK?’”
Lucas, who transitioned eight years ago when he was 18, anticipates running out of hormone treatments in June. In the best case scenario he can foresee now, he will be able to get a new prescription in August. He fears he might start to get his period again. 
“It’s just going to be extremely difficult mentally to have your body changing in a way that doesn’t align with your brain,” Lucas said.


  

Eli and Lucas have switched to a month-to-month lease and tentatively plan to relocate to Minnesota in November. They said they would leave sooner if they can afford it and started an online fundraiser to help. Moving with their dog and two cats increases the expense and difficulty of finding a new place.
“I just never thought it could happen this way, this fast and to us,” Eli said.

tallahassee fla apdebate surrounding florida’s new restrictions on genderaffirming care focused largely on transgender children but a new law that republican presidential candidate and gov ron desantis signed last month also made it difficult – even impossible – for many transgender adults to get treatment
eli and lucas trans men who are a couple followed the discussions in the legislature where democrats warned that trans children would be more prone to suicide under a ban on genderaffirming care for minors and republicans responded with misplaced tales of mutilated kids eli said he and his partner felt “blindsided” when they discovered the bill contained language that would also disrupt their lives


  

“there was no communication … nobody was really talking about it in our circles” said eli 29
like many transgender adults in florida he and lucas are now facing tough choices including whether to uproot their lives so that they can continue to access genderconfirming care clinics are also trying to figure out how to operate under regulations that have made florida a test case for restrictions on adults
lucas 26 lost his access to treatment when the orlando clinic that prescribed him hormone replacement therapy stopped providing genderaffirming care altogether the couple also worries about staying in a state that this year enacted several other bills targeting the lgbtq community
“my entire life is here all my friends my family i just got a promotion at my job which i’m probably not to be able to keep” lucas who works in a financial aid office at a college said “i’m losing everything except eli and my pets moving out of here so this was not a decision that i took lightly at all”
the associated press is not using eli’s and lucas’ last names because they fear reprisal while their friends and families know they are trans most people who meet them do not
the new law that bans genderaffirming care for minors also mandates that adult patients seeking trans health care sign an informed consent form it also requires a physician to oversee any health care related to transitioning and for people to see that doctor in person those rules have proven particularly onerous because many people received care from nurse practitioners and used telehealth the law also made it a crime to violate the new requirements


  

another new law that allows doctors and pharmacists to refuse to treat transgender people further limits their options
“for trans adults it’s devastating” said kate steinle chief clinical officer at folx health which provides genderaffirming care to trans adults through telemedicine her company decided to open inperson clinics and hire more physicians licensed in florida in order to continue to provide care to patients who have already enrolled even though that represents a major change to the company’s business model
eli has been seeing a physician for years and therefore still has access to care but spektrum health inc the orlando clinic that prescribed lucas hormone replacement therapy has stopped providing genderaffirming care


  

“there are a lot of people looking for care that we’re no longer legally able to provide” said lana dunn spektrum health’s chief operating officer 
florida has the secondlargest population of transgender adults in the us at an estimated 94900 people according to the williams institute at the university of california los angeles school of law it used statelevel populationbased surveys to determine its estimates not all transgender people seek medical interventions
at least 19 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning genderaffirming medical care for transgender minors but restrictions on adults haven’t been part of the conversation in most places missouri’s attorney general tried to impose a rule in that state but it was pulled back


  

florida is “the proving ground of what they can get away with” dunn said
her organization treats about 4000 peoplemost in florida and some outofstate telehealth patients she said while spektrum has bolstered its mental health services since the law passed it and other organizations heavily rely on nurse practitioners to provide care
dunn estimates that 80 of trans adults in the state were getting their health care from a nurse practitioner and now have lost access


  

“right now what we’re seeing in the community is just chaos” dunn said
the law also contains language that she said could scare off doctors who would be otherwise willing to treat trans patients such as a 20year statute of limitations to sue over care they provide
as a trans woman herself dunn is grappling with losing her own access to hormones while trying to provide support to terrified patients that’s taken “a significant emotional toll” she said


  

“not only am i faced with this lack of care for myself but a lot of people within the community are also facing the same thing and they’re reaching out to me for guidance” dunn said “so i’m doing my best to help guide people and console them but nobody’s really reaching out to me saying ’how are you doing are you ok’”
lucas who transitioned eight years ago when he was 18 anticipates running out of hormone treatments in june in the best case scenario he can foresee now he will be able to get a new prescription in august he fears he might start to get his period again 
“it’s just going to be extremely difficult mentally to have your body changing in a way that doesn’t align with your brain” lucas said


  

eli and lucas have switched to a monthtomonth lease and tentatively plan to relocate to minnesota in november they said they would leave sooner if they can afford it and started an online fundraiser to help moving with their dog and two cats increases the expense and difficulty of finding a new place
“i just never thought it could happen this way this fast and to us” eli said

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s 2024 bid is likely to feature criticism of Donald Trump front and center, offering a test of just how much appetite there is in the GOP for an explicitly anti-Trump candidate.
Christie’s expected presidential bid has been greeted with skepticism from Republicans, some of whom suggest his candidacy is a mere vanity project, while others are quick to point out that Christie, now a vocal Trump critic, had worked closely to help reelect the former president in 2020.


  

But even some of those Republicans acknowledge that the former New Jersey governor’s pugilistic style could have an impact on the field and potentially even damage Trump to a degree.
“If it’s not a vanity campaign, I think its value … is that he can go in there and throw the hard punches, and maybe other candidates in the field can benefit from that,” said GOP strategist Jason Cabel Roe, who worked on presidential campaigns for Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) in 2008 and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in 2016.
Much of the 2024 GOP field has largely avoided taking on Trump, as the contenders navigate the tricky dance of embracing positions and policies that were popular among conservatives during the Trump administration while differentiating themselves from the former president himself. 
While presidential primaries generally see candidates volley attacks at each other, 2024 Republican contenders are also keenly aware that attacking Trump could risk alienating voters they need to win over who still admire the former president.
But Christie hasn’t shied away from taking jabs at the former president. Following disappointing midterm results last November for Republicans, the former New Jersey governor pointed to a number of Trump-backed candidates who lost their races, saying it was a “huge loss for Trump.”
“And again, it shows that his political instincts are not about the party, they’re not about the country, they’re about him,” he added at the time.


  

During Trump’s appearance at CPAC earlier this year, Christie also took a shot at the former president and the size of his audience attending his speech.
“You saw the scenes at CPAC, that room was half-full,” Christie said in March. “The reason I don’t think the rallies are going on … I don’t think the rallies would be nearly as big as they were before.”
Arizona-based GOP strategist and Trump campaign alum Brian Seitchik believed Christie’s anti-Trump focus might come with some long-term benefits if another Republican gets the nomination and wins the presidency, but suggested it’s not likely to win over GOP voters for Christie himself.


  

“If Trump loses New Hampshire, Christie is going to be a part of it, but I just don’t see the voters rewarding him as a result,” Seitchik said.
“Now, that may lead to a future Republican nominee and president rewarding him with [naming him] attorney general, which is not a bad consolation prize, but it’s hard to see how Christie gets to be the [nominee] playing the role of junkyard dog in this race.”
GOP strategist Keith Naughton suggested Christie would focus mainly on Trump rather than some kind of different vision for the party. 


  

“I don’t think he’s going to offer really some type of alternative platform or anything, I think he’s mostly going to be talking about Trump and trying to pick fights with him,” Naughton said.
At the same time, members of the party acknowledge that Christie’s feistiness has been effective in the past and could possibly knock Trump down a few pegs. Christie took a number of jabs at Rubio during a 2016 New Hampshire debate, slamming him for returning to a “memorized 25-second speech,” and has been credited for seriously damaging the Florida senator’s presidential bid. 
Rubio later placed fifth in the New Hampshire primary while Christie placed sixth, with the Florida senator acknowledging that he didn’t do well the night of the debate. 


  

Unlike most of the pack, Christie’s also the only one who debated Trump in 2016. He also assisted the former president in debate prep during the 2020 cycle, giving him better insight into the ins and outs of Trump’s thinking on a debate stage. 
Republican strategist and former Christie aide Colin Reed suggested that forcefully going after Trump would benefit the former governor.
“History shows that just sitting back and waiting for Donald Trump to implode is not a recipe for success politically,” Reed said.


  

“The one thing that I think distinguishes [Christie] so far from the rest of the field is he’s not going to hesitate or shy away from critiques of the former president in articulating why [Trump’s] not the right candidate to become the next president,” he added.
Reed also pushed back on the notion that Christie’s candidacy wasn’t a serious one, saying, “he wouldn’t be embarking on this endeavor if he didn’t think there was [a] viable pathway for his own candidacy.”

Other Republicans, too, are stressing that members of the party need to have an open mind about the burgeoning field, saying it’s too early to write off candidates like Christie.


  

“Donald Trump’s the frontrunner, and when he ran the first time, no one gave him a chance. And so I think there’s some of those same conversations going on about Mike Pence, right? If Donald Trump is to somehow get knocked off or falter, the race potentially resets,” GOP strategist Douglas Heye explained.
“DeSantis is probably in the strongest position of anybody, but if the race resets, no one is smart enough to know exactly in what direction that will happen. And so it’s premature at this point to write somebody off, especially somebody with the political and communication skills of a Chris Christie,” he added.

Former FBI Director James Comey predicted on Sunday that former President Trump “could be wearing an ankle bracelet” when accepting the GOP nomination if he wins it in 2024, as the former president faces a number of legal challenges.
Comey said on MSNBC’s “Inside with Jen Psaki” that he doesn’t “want to” but “could” envision Trump getting the Republican nod. 


  

“I mean, it’s this crazy world that Donald Trump has dragged this country into, but he could be wearing an ankle bracelet while accepting the nomination at the Republican convention,” Comey said.
“You would be rejected if you put it in a script for a show, but you could have a president who is potentially incarcerated when he is elected president,” he added.
Trump if facing a slew of legal woes including an indicted on criminal charges in New York, and two Justice Department inquiries led by special counsel Jack Smith. A Georgia prosecutor is probing attempts to overturn the state’s election results in 2020, and Trump was also found liable last month for sexual abuse and defamation writer E. Jean Carroll. 
As he runs for another term in the White House, Trump has said he won’t drop out of the 2024 race for any legal reason. He’s still legally able to lodge his campaign even as he faces charges and the other ongoing legal battles.
Trump fired Comey as FBI director during his tenure at the White House in May 2017. Trump cited Comey’s handling of an investigation involving an email server belonging the Hillary Clinton while she was running as Trump’s opponent in the 2016 election even though it benefitted him politically.

Trump ultimately let Comey go over investigations involving Russia and Trump’s aides though Comey had informed Trump that he himself was not being probed.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Debate surrounding Florida’s new restrictions on gender-affirming care focused largely on transgender children. But a new law that Republican presidential candidate and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed last month also made it difficult – even impossible – for many transgender adults to get treatment.
Eli and Lucas, trans men who are a couple, followed the discussions in the Legislature, where Democrats warned that trans children would be more prone to suicide under a ban on gender-affirming care for minors and Republicans responded with misplaced tales of mutilated kids. Eli said he and his partner felt “blindsided” when they discovered the bill contained language that would also disrupt their lives.


  

“There was no communication. … Nobody was really talking about it in our circles,” said Eli, 29.
Like many transgender adults in Florida, he and Lucas are now facing tough choices, including whether to uproot their lives so that they can continue to access gender-confirming care. Clinics are also trying to figure out how to operate under regulations that have made Florida a test case for restrictions on adults.
Lucas, 26, lost his access to treatment when the Orlando clinic that prescribed him hormone replacement therapy stopped providing gender-affirming care altogether. The couple also worries about staying in a state that this year enacted several other bills targeting the LGBTQ+ community.
“My entire life is here. All my friends, my family. I just got a promotion at my job, which I’m probably not to be able to keep,” Lucas, who works in a financial aid office at a college, said. “I’m losing everything except Eli and my pets moving out of here. So this was not a decision that I took lightly at all.”
The Associated Press is not using Eli’s and Lucas’ last names because they fear reprisal. While their friends and families know they are trans, most people who meet them do not.
The new law that bans gender-affirming care for minors also mandates that adult patients seeking trans health care sign an informed consent form. It also requires a physician to oversee any health care related to transitioning, and for people to see that doctor in person. Those rules have proven particularly onerous because many people received care from nurse practitioners and used telehealth. The law also made it a crime to violate the new requirements.


  

Another new law that allows doctors and pharmacists to refuse to treat transgender people further limits their options.
“For trans adults, it’s devastating,” said Kate Steinle, chief clinical officer at FOLX Health, which provides gender-affirming care to trans adults through telemedicine. Her company decided to open in-person clinics and hire more physicians licensed in Florida in order to continue to provide care to patients who have already enrolled, even though that represents a major change to the company’s business model.
Eli has been seeing a physician for years and therefore still has access to care. But SPEKTRUM Health Inc., the Orlando clinic that prescribed Lucas hormone replacement therapy, has stopped providing gender-affirming care.


  

“There are a lot of people looking for care that we’re no longer legally able to provide,” said Lana Dunn, SPEKTRUM Health’s chief operating officer. 
Florida has the second-largest population of transgender adults in the U.S., at an estimated 94,900 people, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. It used state-level, population-based surveys to determine its estimates. Not all transgender people seek medical interventions.
At least 19 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. But restrictions on adults haven’t been part of the conversation in most places. Missouri’s attorney general tried to impose a rule in that state, but it was pulled back.


  

Florida is “the proving ground of what they can get away with,” Dunn said.
Her organization treats about 4,000 people — most in Florida and some out-of-state telehealth patients, she said. While SPEKTRUM has bolstered its mental health services since the law passed, it and other organizations heavily rely on nurse practitioners to provide care.
Dunn estimates that 80% of trans adults in the state were getting their health care from a nurse practitioner and now have lost access.


  

“Right now what we’re seeing in the community is just chaos,” Dunn said.
The law also contains language that she said could scare off doctors who would be otherwise willing to treat trans patients, such as a 20-year statute of limitations to sue over care they provide.
As a trans woman herself, Dunn is grappling with losing her own access to hormones while trying to provide support to terrified patients. That’s taken “a significant emotional toll,” she said.


  

“Not only am I faced with this lack of care for myself but a lot of people within the community are also facing the same thing, and they’re reaching out to me for guidance,” Dunn said. “So I’m doing my best to help guide people and console them, but nobody’s really reaching out to me saying, ’How are you doing? Are you OK?’”
Lucas, who transitioned eight years ago when he was 18, anticipates running out of hormone treatments in June. In the best case scenario he can foresee now, he will be able to get a new prescription in August. He fears he might start to get his period again. 
“It’s just going to be extremely difficult mentally to have your body changing in a way that doesn’t align with your brain,” Lucas said.


  

Eli and Lucas have switched to a month-to-month lease and tentatively plan to relocate to Minnesota in November. They said they would leave sooner if they can afford it and started an online fundraiser to help. Moving with their dog and two cats increases the expense and difficulty of finding a new place.
“I just never thought it could happen this way, this fast and to us,” Eli said.

White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Sunday that President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet “at some point” as tensions between the two countries continue to rise.
During an appearance on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” host Fareed Zakaria asked Sullivan if he agrees with recent comments made by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger who told The Economist that U.S.-China relations were “in the classic pre-World War One situation where neither side” knows that they don’t have any political room to make any concessions on the matter. 


  

“I sat in the room with President Biden when he met with President Xi in Bali last year, and that was not my experience,” Sullivan told Zakaria, adding that the two world leaders tried to reach an understanding.
“And the desire on both parts to put a floor under the relationship, to manage the competition responsibly, to ensure that competition does not become conflict,” Sullivan added. “And there are a number of different elements to that. But one of the key ones is that as we have intense competition, we also have intense diplomacy.”

Sullivan also told Zakaria that he just met with his Chinese counterpart, the director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission Wang Yi, where both diplomats discussed “all of the strategic issues” in their ongoing relationship, adding that he hopes to see discussions between the two countries continue in the coming months. 
“And then, at some point, we will see President Biden and President Xi come back together again. So as far as I’m concerned, there is nothing inconsistent with, on the one hand, competing vigorously in important domains on economics and technology, and also ensuring that that competition does not veer into conflict or confrontation. That is the firm conviction of President Biden. That is how he will responsibly manage this relationship,” Sullivan said. “And we believe there is nothing inevitable about some kind of conflict or cold war between the U.S. and China.” 
Tensions between the U.S. and China have heightened over the years. U.S. officials earlier this year raised concerns that China could give Russia lethal aid during its ongoing war with Ukraine.

As gas prices remain flat, the group of oil-producing nations decided on Sunday to extend oil production cuts through 2024.  
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its partners, named OPEC Plus, held a meeting Sunday where the group — led by Russia and Saudi Arabia — decided to extend the oil production cuts. OPEC described the move as aiming to “achieve and sustain a stable oil market, and to provide long-term guidance for the market, and in line with the successful approach of being precautious, proactive and preemptive,” in a press release.

Saudi Arabia, along with Russia and other OPEC+ oil producers, announced in April that they are planning on cutting 1.16 million barrels per day. This decision came after the oil producing countries had already pledged to cut production of 2 million barrels a day through the end of the year. 
The National Security Council criticized the move at the time, saying that the administration does not think cuts are “advisable at this moment given market uncertainty.” President Biden had also threatened that there would be “consequences” for Saudi Arabia, after the country announced the production cut last October of about 2 million barrels per day. 
This move is not expected to affect gas prices in the United States, as pump prices have remained flat even after Memorial Day weekend travel. As of Sunday, the national average of gas prices was $3.55 per gallon, according to AAA.

Former Obama White House senior political adviser David Axelrod says Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is “dead man walking” in West Virginia, where the senior senator finds himself far behind in the polls ahead of the 2024 election.  
Axelrod on Monday said the dim outlook of Manchin’s reelection bid may lead him to instead run for president as a third-party candidate, which the senior Democratic strategist called “a graceful exit for him.” 


  

“I don’t want to be unkind to Sen. Manchin, but he’s kind of dead man walking in West Virginia. There’s nowhere for him to go,” Axelrod said on CNN, referring to a new poll showing the three-term senator trailing West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) by 22 points. 
“There’s nowhere for him to go. He’s got a popular Republican governor in the state that Donald Trump carried by almost 40 points. He didn’t win by very much last time. So he knows that he can’t win reelection in that state,” he said.  
An East Carolina University poll of 957 registered West Virginia voters conducted May 22 and May 23 found Justice leading Manchin 54 percent to 32 percent in a hypothetical matchup, with 13 percent of voters undecided.  
The poll, however, showed Manchin trailing Rep. Alex Mooney (W.Va.), another Republican candidate in the Senate race, by only 1 point — 41 percent to 40 percent, with 18 percent undecided.  
Manchin says he won’t decide whether to run for reelection until the end of this year, and he isn’t ruling out a potential presidential bid.  
Asked over the weekend whether a presidential bid is still possible, Manchin said, “You better have Plan B, because if Plan A shows we’re going to the far reaches of both sides, the far left and the far right…” referring to the unpopularity of President Biden and former President Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president.  


  

Manchin declined to “include or exclude” himself as a possible third-party candidate.  
He beat Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey in the 2018 Senate race, 49.6 percent to 46.3 percent. 
Trump carried West Virginia by 42 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and then beat Biden by a similar margin in the state in 2020, 68.6 percent to 29.7 percent.

Manchin declared last month, “I will win any race I enter,” and said he is “laser focused on doing the job West Virginians elected me to do.” 
He has suggested that while Justice, a former Democrat, is popular in West Virginia, he may have a hard time winning the Senate Republican nomination over Mooney. 
“Let the games begin. It’s going to be a very entertaining primary on their side,” he said.

Donald Trump is headed to the Supreme Court.
His name, that is.


  

The justices Monday agreed to take up a trademark dispute implicating the First Amendment, and a joke about the former president is at the center.
For five years, California man Steve Elster has been attempting to trademark “Trump too small” to use on shirts, a reference to a 2016 Republican presidential debate in which Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) made fun of Trump’s hand size.
Elster’s application was refused in part because of a federal statute that requires marks consisting of a living person’s name to have that person’s consent. Trump did not sign off.
On appeal, a federal court struck down the provision as applied to Elster, ruling it violated the First Amendment’s free speech protections because he was criticizing a government official or public figure.
The Biden-era Justice Department, representing the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, then appealed to the nation’s highest court, asking them to weigh in because a lower court had invalidated a federal law.
The case, Vidal v. Elster, is slated to be heard during the court’s next annual term, which begins in October. 


  

Trump’s brand will also be at the center of a case at the court next term over whether a group of Democratic lawmakers should be able to sue to obtain documents related to Trump’s former Washington, D.C., hotel. Trump is not a party in either case.
No matter the court’s decision, Elster’s trademark application remains blocked under another provision that bans registered marks suggesting a false association with a person, living or dead. 
The dispute follows two recent cases in which the Supreme Court found that other trademark prohibitions — which banned registration of marks that were immoral, scandalous or disparaging — violated the First Amendment.


  

But the Justice Department in court filings contended those decisions banned speech based on its viewpoint, and the provision at issue in Elster’s case is viewpoint-neutral.
The government further wants the justices to treat trademark prohibitions as a condition on a government benefit rather than a simple restriction on speech.

“Refusal of trademark registration under Section 1052(c) does not prevent the mark owner from using the individual’s name, without that individual’s consent, in whatever speech the owner wishes to engage in,” the Justice Department wrote in its brief.


  

Elster responded by asking the justices to let the lower ruling stand, noting there was no split among the federal appeals courts to resolve, and that arguing the case anyway was a poor vehicle to resolve the constitutional question.
“Unlike other cases in which the Court has reviewed decisions declaring federal statutes unconstitutional, this case involves a one-off as-applied constitutional challenge—one that turns on the unique circumstances of the government’s refusal to register a trademark that voices political criticism of a former President of the United States,” Elster’s attorney wrote.

House Oversight and Accountability Committee leaders briefed by the FBI on the details of a tip into potential wrongdoing by President Biden disagreed on basic conclusions, including whether it’s part of an ongoing probe.
Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) vowed to continue with his plans to hold FBI Director Christopher Wray in contempt for failing to physically turn over the document lawmakers reviewed alongside agents during an hour and a half long briefing. The FBI called the move an unwarranted escalation.


  

Comer said the tip, memorialized in a document he subpoenaed from the FBI, is part of an ongoing investigation and alleges Biden may have accepted a bribe during his tenure as vice president.
“Given the severity and complexity of the allegations contained within this record, Congress must investigate further,” he said after the Monday briefing.
“This is only the beginning. It appears this investigation is part of an ongoing investigation, which I assume is in Delaware.”

Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.) the top Democrat on the panel, on the other hand, said the FBI decided not to advance its initial investigation into the matter, determining the secondhand information did not warrant followup by the group then-Attorney General BIll Barr tasked with assessing it.
“What we’re talking about here is a confidential human source reporting a conversation with someone else. So we’re talking about is secondhand hearsay,” Raskin said, adding that the source “had no way of knowing about the underlying veracity of the things that he was being told.” 
“And they did whatever investigative due diligence was called for in that assessment period, and they found no reason to escalate it from an assessment to a so-called preliminary investigation,” he added.


  

“FBI prosecutorial protocol is whether there are articulable facts giving rise to suspicion of criminal activity. So they apparently decided there was not, and they called an end to the investigation.”
Both CNN and NBC have reported that a team led by then-U.S. Attorney Scott Brady was unable to corroborate the 2020 allegation.
Comer said the panel will meet Thursday to vote on whether to hold Wray in contempt of Congress because “the FBI again refused to hand over the unclassified record to the custody of the House Oversight Committee.”


  

In a statement Monday the FBI stressed the accommodations given to the panel.
“The FBI has continually demonstrated its commitment to accommodate the committee’s request, including by producing the document in a reading room at the U.S. Capitol. This commonsense safeguard is often employed in response to congressional requests and in court proceedings to protect important concerns, such as the physical safety of sources and the integrity of investigations,” the agency said in a statement.
“The escalation to a contempt vote under these circumstances is unwarranted.” 


  

Comer issued a subpoena last month compelling Wray to produce any FD-1023 forms — records of interactions with confidential sources — from June 2020 that contain the word “Biden.”
He has claimed the form contains information related to “an alleged criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions.”
Both Comer and Raskin agreed that the information came from a highly credible paid source the FBI has relied on for years.


  

But the two men otherwise left with remarkably different impressions of the briefing.
“All I know is there’s an ongoing investigation. They confirm there’s an ongoing investigation using this information. I assume that ongoing investigation is in Delaware. I don’t know that, but I assume that,” Comer said.
When asked by The Hill whether he had information to support that claim, Comer responded, “I assume it’s Delaware. I’ll put it like that.”


  

Raskin seemed surprised by Comer’s claim the investigation is ongoing.
“Not only were there no criminal charges, there was no escalation of the FBI investigation,” Raskin said.
“All I will tell you is that there was a complete Department of Justice, U.S. attorney and FBI team that was set up to investigate the allegations that surfaced after Rudy Giuliani was making particular allegations.” 


  

Raskin later clarified in a statement that, “much of the information provided by the source was information Mr. Giuliani had already provided the FBI.”
The probe into the vague allegation against Biden appears to be intertwined with Comer’s probe into overseas business dealings by the president’s family members, including his son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden, as well as their associates.
“The claims made in the document are consistent with what we found and disclosed to you all in Romania,” Comer said, referring to financial records that the committee’s Republicans reported in an interim memo on the Biden family business dealings last month. “It suggests a pattern of bribery where payments would be made through shell accounts and multiple banks. There’s a term for that, it’s called money laundering.”
Republicans on the committee have gained access to suspicious activity reports generated by banks that they say show more than $10 million that flowed from foreign entities to companies associated with the Biden family and its associates. Those suspicious activity reports do not necessarily mean any illegal transactions occurred.
Raskin on Monday also pushed back against Comer’s plans to hold Wray in contempt, something he said would mark the first time in history such a motion has been brought against an FBI director.
“The document, like all documents relating to all confidential human sources, is one that should not be released publicly because it could endanger the confidential human source and then undermine our whole law enforcement system that the FBI has put into place,” he said.

		Scarborough says he thinks Trump kept documents to make deals: ‘This is all about money’	

Raskin called releasing the document — something Comer has said he is considering — “totally out of bounds.”
“We have the FBI, which came over to us, brought the very document we’re looking for, and gave even the majority — I think, 90 or 95 percent — of what was being asked for, which was the document and all kinds of surrounding answers to questions about the document. Now, it seems like the goalpost has shifted a little bit.”

house oversight and accountability committee leaders briefed by the fbi on the details of a tip into potential wrongdoing by president biden disagreed on basic conclusions including whether it’s part of an ongoing probe
chairman james comer rky vowed to continue with his plans to hold fbi director christopher wray in contempt for failing to physically turn over the document lawmakers reviewed alongside agents during an hour and a half long briefing the fbi called the move an unwarranted escalation


  

comer said the tip memorialized in a document he subpoenaed from the fbi is part of an ongoing investigation and alleges biden may have accepted a bribe during his tenure as vice president
“given the severity and complexity of the allegations contained within this record congress must investigate further” he said after the monday briefing
“this is only the beginning it appears this investigation is part of an ongoing investigation which i assume is in delaware”

rep jamie raskin md the top democrat on the panel on the other hand said the fbi decided not to advance its initial investigation into the matter determining the secondhand information did not warrant followup by the group thenattorney general bill barr tasked with assessing it
“what we’re talking about here is a confidential human source reporting a conversation with someone else so we’re talking about is secondhand hearsay” raskin said adding that the source “had no way of knowing about the underlying veracity of the things that he was being told” 
“and they did whatever investigative due diligence was called for in that assessment period and they found no reason to escalate it from an assessment to a socalled preliminary investigation” he added


  

“fbi prosecutorial protocol is whether there are articulable facts giving rise to suspicion of criminal activity so they apparently decided there was not and they called an end to the investigation”
both  and nbc have reported that a team led by thenus attorney scott brady was unable to corroborate the 2020 allegation
comer said the panel will meet thursday to vote on whether to hold wray in contempt of congress because “the fbi again refused to hand over the unclassified record to the custody of the house oversight committee”


  

in a statement monday the fbi stressed the accommodations given to the panel
“the fbi has continually demonstrated its commitment to accommodate the committee’s request including by producing the document in a reading room at the us capitol this commonsense safeguard is often employed in response to congressional requests and in court proceedings to protect important concerns such as the physical safety of sources and the integrity of investigations” the agency said in a statement
“the escalation to a contempt vote under these circumstances is unwarranted” 


  

comer issued a subpoena last month compelling wray to produce any fd1023 formsrecords of interactions with confidential sourcesfrom june 2020 that contain the word “biden”
he has claimed the form contains information related to “an alleged criminal scheme involving thenvice president biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions”
both comer and raskin agreed that the information came from a highly credible paid source the fbi has relied on for years


  

but the two men otherwise left with remarkably different impressions of the briefing
“all i know is there’s an ongoing investigation they confirm there’s an ongoing investigation using this information i assume that ongoing investigation is in delaware i don’t know that but i assume that” comer said
when asked by the hill whether he had information to support that claim comer responded “i assume it’s delaware i’ll put it like that”


  

raskin seemed surprised by comer’s claim the investigation is ongoing
“not only were there no criminal charges there was no escalation of the fbi investigation” raskin said
“all i will tell you is that there was a complete department of justice us attorney and fbi team that was set up to investigate the allegations that surfaced after rudy giuliani was making particular allegations” 


  

raskin later clarified in a statement that “much of the information provided by the source was information mr giuliani had already provided the fbi”
the probe into the vague allegation against biden appears to be intertwined with comer’s probe into overseas business dealings by the president’s family members including his son hunter biden and brother james biden as well as their associates
“the claims made in the document are consistent with what we found and disclosed to you all in romania” comer said referring to financial records that the committee’s republicans reported in an interim memo on the biden family business dealings last month “it suggests a pattern of bribery where payments would be made through shell accounts and multiple banks there’s a term for that it’s called money laundering”
republicans on the committee have gained access to suspicious activity reports generated by banks that they say show more than 10 million that flowed from foreign entities to companies associated with the biden family and its associates those suspicious activity reports do not necessarily mean any illegal transactions occurred
raskin on monday also pushed back against comer’s plans to hold wray in contempt something he said would mark the first time in history such a motion has been brought against an fbi director
“the document like all documents relating to all confidential human sources is one that should not be released publicly because it could endanger the confidential human source and then undermine our whole law enforcement system that the fbi has put into place” he said

raskin called releasing the documentsomething comer has said he is considering“totally out of bounds”

Former Obama White House senior political adviser David Axelrod says Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is “dead man walking” in West Virginia, where the senior senator finds himself far behind in the polls ahead of the 2024 election.  
Axelrod on Monday said the dim outlook of Manchin’s reelection bid may lead him to instead run for president as a third-party candidate, which the senior Democratic strategist called “a graceful exit for him.” 


  

“I don’t want to be unkind to Sen. Manchin, but he’s kind of dead man walking in West Virginia. There’s nowhere for him to go,” Axelrod said on CNN, referring to a new poll showing the three-term senator trailing West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) by 22 points. 
“There’s nowhere for him to go. He’s got a popular Republican governor in the state that Donald Trump carried by almost 40 points. He didn’t win by very much last time. So he knows that he can’t win reelection in that state,” he said.  
An East Carolina University poll of 957 registered West Virginia voters conducted May 22 and May 23 found Justice leading Manchin 54 percent to 32 percent in a hypothetical matchup, with 13 percent of voters undecided.  
The poll, however, showed Manchin trailing Rep. Alex Mooney (W.Va.), another Republican candidate in the Senate race, by only 1 point — 41 percent to 40 percent, with 18 percent undecided.  
Manchin says he won’t decide whether to run for reelection until the end of this year, and he isn’t ruling out a potential presidential bid.  
Asked over the weekend whether a presidential bid is still possible, Manchin said, “You better have Plan B, because if Plan A shows we’re going to the far reaches of both sides, the far left and the far right…” referring to the unpopularity of President Biden and former President Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president.  


  

Manchin declined to “include or exclude” himself as a possible third-party candidate.  
He beat Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey in the 2018 Senate race, 49.6 percent to 46.3 percent. 
Trump carried West Virginia by 42 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and then beat Biden by a similar margin in the state in 2020, 68.6 percent to 29.7 percent.

		Wildfire smoke makes weekend comeback as Canadian fires rage 	

Manchin declared last month, “I will win any race I enter,” and said he is “laser focused on doing the job West Virginians elected me to do.” 
He has suggested that while Justice, a former Democrat, is popular in West Virginia, he may have a hard time winning the Senate Republican nomination over Mooney. 
“Let the games begin. It’s going to be a very entertaining primary on their side,” he said.

Donald Trump is headed to the Supreme Court.
His name, that is.


  

The justices Monday agreed to take up a trademark dispute implicating the First Amendment, and a joke about the former president is at the center.
For five years, California man Steve Elster has been attempting to trademark “Trump too small” to use on shirts, a reference to a 2016 Republican presidential debate in which Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) made fun of Trump’s hand size.
Elster’s application was refused in part because of a federal statute that requires marks consisting of a living person’s name to have that person’s consent. Trump did not sign off.
On appeal, a federal court struck down the provision as applied to Elster, ruling it violated the First Amendment’s free speech protections because he was criticizing a government official or public figure.
The Biden-era Justice Department, representing the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, then appealed to the nation’s highest court, asking them to weigh in because a lower court had invalidated a federal law.
The case, Vidal v. Elster, is slated to be heard during the court’s next annual term, which begins in October. 


  

Trump’s brand will also be at the center of a case at the court next term over whether a group of Democratic lawmakers should be able to sue to obtain documents related to Trump’s former Washington, D.C., hotel. Trump is not a party in either case.
No matter the court’s decision, Elster’s trademark application remains blocked under another provision that bans registered marks suggesting a false association with a person, living or dead. 
The dispute follows two recent cases in which the Supreme Court found that other trademark prohibitions — which banned registration of marks that were immoral, scandalous or disparaging — violated the First Amendment.


  

But the Justice Department in court filings contended those decisions banned speech based on its viewpoint, and the provision at issue in Elster’s case is viewpoint-neutral.
The government further wants the justices to treat trademark prohibitions as a condition on a government benefit rather than a simple restriction on speech.

“Refusal of trademark registration under Section 1052(c) does not prevent the mark owner from using the individual’s name, without that individual’s consent, in whatever speech the owner wishes to engage in,” the Justice Department wrote in its brief.


  

Elster responded by asking the justices to let the lower ruling stand, noting there was no split among the federal appeals courts to resolve, and that arguing the case anyway was a poor vehicle to resolve the constitutional question.
“Unlike other cases in which the Court has reviewed decisions declaring federal statutes unconstitutional, this case involves a one-off as-applied constitutional challenge—one that turns on the unique circumstances of the government’s refusal to register a trademark that voices political criticism of a former President of the United States,” Elster’s attorney wrote.

the dispute follows two recent cases in which the supreme court found that other trademark prohibitionswhich banned registration of marks that were immoral scandalous or disparagingviolated the first amendment


  

but the justice department in court filings contended those decisions banned speech based on its viewpoint and the provision at issue in elster’s case is viewpointneutral
the government further wants the justices to treat trademark prohibitions as a condition on a government benefit rather than a simple restriction on speech

“refusal of trademark registration under section 1052c does not prevent the mark owner from using the individual’s name without that individual’s consent in whatever speech the owner wishes to engage in” the justice department wrote in its brief


  

elster responded by asking the justices to let the lower ruling stand noting there was no split among the federal appeals courts to resolve and that arguing the case anyway was a poor vehicle to resolve the constitutional question
“unlike other cases in which the court has reviewed decisions declaring federal statutes unconstitutional this case involves a oneoff asapplied constitutional challenge—one that turns on the unique circumstances of the government’s refusal to register a trademark that voices political criticism of a former president of the united states” elster’s attorney wrote

House Oversight and Accountability Committee leaders briefed by the FBI on the details of a tip into potential wrongdoing by President Biden disagreed on basic conclusions, including whether it’s part of an ongoing probe.
Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) vowed to continue with his plans to hold FBI Director Christopher Wray in contempt for failing to physically turn over the document lawmakers reviewed alongside agents during an hour and a half long briefing. The FBI called the move an unwarranted escalation.


  

Comer said the tip, memorialized in a document he subpoenaed from the FBI, is part of an ongoing investigation and alleges Biden may have accepted a bribe during his tenure as vice president.
“Given the severity and complexity of the allegations contained within this record, Congress must investigate further,” he said after the Monday briefing.
“This is only the beginning. It appears this investigation is part of an ongoing investigation, which I assume is in Delaware.”

Rep. Jamie Raskin (Md.) the top Democrat on the panel, on the other hand, said the FBI decided not to advance its initial investigation into the matter, determining the secondhand information did not warrant followup by the group then-Attorney General BIll Barr tasked with assessing it.
“What we’re talking about here is a confidential human source reporting a conversation with someone else. So we’re talking about is secondhand hearsay,” Raskin said, adding that the source “had no way of knowing about the underlying veracity of the things that he was being told.” 
“And they did whatever investigative due diligence was called for in that assessment period, and they found no reason to escalate it from an assessment to a so-called preliminary investigation,” he added.


  

“FBI prosecutorial protocol is whether there are articulable facts giving rise to suspicion of criminal activity. So they apparently decided there was not, and they called an end to the investigation.”
Both CNN and NBC have reported that a team led by then-U.S. Attorney Scott Brady was unable to corroborate the 2020 allegation.
Comer said the panel will meet Thursday to vote on whether to hold Wray in contempt of Congress because “the FBI again refused to hand over the unclassified record to the custody of the House Oversight Committee.”


  

In a statement Monday the FBI stressed the accommodations given to the panel.
“The FBI has continually demonstrated its commitment to accommodate the committee’s request, including by producing the document in a reading room at the U.S. Capitol. This commonsense safeguard is often employed in response to congressional requests and in court proceedings to protect important concerns, such as the physical safety of sources and the integrity of investigations,” the agency said in a statement.
“The escalation to a contempt vote under these circumstances is unwarranted.” 


  

Comer issued a subpoena last month compelling Wray to produce any FD-1023 forms — records of interactions with confidential sources — from June 2020 that contain the word “Biden.”
He has claimed the form contains information related to “an alleged criminal scheme involving then-Vice President Biden and a foreign national relating to the exchange of money for policy decisions.”
Both Comer and Raskin agreed that the information came from a highly credible paid source the FBI has relied on for years.


  

But the two men otherwise left with remarkably different impressions of the briefing.
“All I know is there’s an ongoing investigation. They confirm there’s an ongoing investigation using this information. I assume that ongoing investigation is in Delaware. I don’t know that, but I assume that,” Comer said.
When asked by The Hill whether he had information to support that claim, Comer responded, “I assume it’s Delaware. I’ll put it like that.”


  

Raskin seemed surprised by Comer’s claim the investigation is ongoing.
“Not only were there no criminal charges, there was no escalation of the FBI investigation,” Raskin said.
“All I will tell you is that there was a complete Department of Justice, U.S. attorney and FBI team that was set up to investigate the allegations that surfaced after Rudy Giuliani was making particular allegations.” 


  

Raskin later clarified in a statement that, “much of the information provided by the source was information Mr. Giuliani had already provided the FBI.”
The probe into the vague allegation against Biden appears to be intertwined with Comer’s probe into overseas business dealings by the president’s family members, including his son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden, as well as their associates.
“The claims made in the document are consistent with what we found and disclosed to you all in Romania,” Comer said, referring to financial records that the committee’s Republicans reported in an interim memo on the Biden family business dealings last month. “It suggests a pattern of bribery where payments would be made through shell accounts and multiple banks. There’s a term for that, it’s called money laundering.”
Republicans on the committee have gained access to suspicious activity reports generated by banks that they say show more than $10 million that flowed from foreign entities to companies associated with the Biden family and its associates. Those suspicious activity reports do not necessarily mean any illegal transactions occurred.
Raskin on Monday also pushed back against Comer’s plans to hold Wray in contempt, something he said would mark the first time in history such a motion has been brought against an FBI director.
“The document, like all documents relating to all confidential human sources, is one that should not be released publicly because it could endanger the confidential human source and then undermine our whole law enforcement system that the FBI has put into place,” he said.

		Wildfire smoke makes weekend comeback as Canadian fires rage 	

Raskin called releasing the document — something Comer has said he is considering — “totally out of bounds.”
“We have the FBI, which came over to us, brought the very document we’re looking for, and gave even the majority — I think, 90 or 95 percent — of what was being asked for, which was the document and all kinds of surrounding answers to questions about the document. Now, it seems like the goalpost has shifted a little bit.”

Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent who spied for Russia and the former Soviet Union, was found dead in his prison cell Monday, according to a release obtained by CBS News. 
Hanssen was found unresponsive at the federal correctional complex in Florence, Colo., pronounced dead after life-saving measures were attempted, according to the release from Kristie Breshears, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) director of communications. 
“Staff requested emergency medical services and life-saving efforts continued. The inmate was subsequently pronounced dead by outside emergency medical personnel,” the release reads.

The 79-year-old had been in custody at the ADX Florence complex for more than two decades, since 2002. He pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage in 2001 and was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
The FBI’s site calls Hanssen “the most damaging spy in Bureau history.” Under an alias, he’d provided Russians with highly classified national security information “in exchange for more than $1.4 million in cash, bank funds, and diamonds.” His espionage activities dated to 1985, according to the FBI page.
The Monday release shared by CBS News did not include information about a cause of death for Hanssen. Breshears noted that no staff or inmates were injured, and the FBI was alerted of the death. The Hill has reached out to the FBOP for more.

Former Attorney General Bill Barr pushed back on former President Trump’s claims that a special counsel’s ongoing documents probe is politically motivated and said he thinks the public eventually will come to realize the former president’s culpability. 
“Over time, people will see that this is not a case of the Department of Justice conducting a witch hunt,” Barr said in an interview on CBS on Tuesday. “In fact, they approached this very delicately and with deference to the president, and this would have gone nowhere had the president just returned the documents. But he jerked them around for a year and a half.”


  

Special counsel Jack Smith is leading an investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents, some of which were discovered in an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home after Trump repeatedly refused to turn the documents over to federal officials once he left the White House.
Trump has repeatedly called investigations into his behavior “witch hunts,” and released a torrent of angry social media posts against federal investigators Tuesday — one day after Trump’s lawyers reportedly met with Smith and other Justice Department (DOJ) officials. Smith is also probing Trump’s efforts to remain in power following the 2020 election.
“The Marxists and Fascists in the DOJ & FBI are going after me at a level and speed never seen before in our Country, and I did nothing wrong,” Trump wrote in one of several posts Tuesday.

In the CBS interview, Barr said he suspects the Monday meeting was “probably held to complain about some aspects of the special counsel’s work,” and that he thinks an indictment is probably on the horizon. 
“I would bet that it’s near,” he said of a federal indictment.

Former Attorney General Bill Barr pushed back on former President Trump’s claims that a special counsel’s ongoing documents probe is politically motivated and said he thinks the public eventually will come to realize the former president’s culpability. 
“Over time, people will see that this is not a case of the Department of Justice conducting a witch hunt,” Barr said in an interview on CBS on Tuesday. “In fact, they approached this very delicately and with deference to the president, and this would have gone nowhere had the president just returned the documents. But he jerked them around for a year and a half.”


  

Special counsel Jack Smith is leading an investigation into Trump’s handling of classified documents, some of which were discovered in an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago home after Trump repeatedly refused to turn the documents over to federal officials once he left the White House.
Trump has repeatedly called investigations into his behavior “witch hunts,” and released a torrent of angry social media posts against federal investigators Tuesday — one day after Trump’s lawyers reportedly met with Smith and other Justice Department (DOJ) officials. Smith is also probing Trump’s efforts to remain in power following the 2020 election.
“The Marxists and Fascists in the DOJ & FBI are going after me at a level and speed never seen before in our Country, and I did nothing wrong,” Trump wrote in one of several posts Tuesday.

House conservatives Tuesday blew up an effort by GOP leadership to advance several bills in a dramatic confrontation on the House floor, the result of a revolt against the debt limit deal cut by Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and President Biden just days earlier.
Eleven Republicans — most of whom are members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus — joined Democrats in voting against a rule to advance four bills related to gas stoves and regulatory reform, enough opposition to tank the rule and block the legislation from advancing to the floor.


  

Just before the vote closed, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) changed his vote to oppose the rule as well, a move that allows him to bring up the rule for another vote at a later time. The rule was blocked by a final vote of 206-220.
The revolt made for a dramatic scene on the House floor, where Scalise huddled with more than a dozen conservatives in the back of the chamber in a tense effort to flip votes and allow the bills to advance to the floor.
The normally-routine rule vote — which was scheduled to be only five minutes — went on for more than 50.
The revolt was also a reality check for McCarthy, who has been taking a victory lap after Congress passed and Biden signed a bill to suspend the debt limit that was the product of negotiations between House Republicans and the White House.
“We’re frustrated at the way this place is operating,” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) — one of the conservatives who voted against the rule — told reporters as the vote was still happening.
“We took a stand in January to end the era of the imperial Speakership, and we’re concerned that the fundamental commitments that allowed Kevin McCarthy to assume the Speakership have been violated as a consequence of the debt limit deal. And, you know, the answer for us is to reassert House conservatives as the appropriate coalition partner for our leadership, instead of them making common cause with Democrats,” he added.

Republican Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Dan Bishop (N.C.), Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Ken Buck (Colo.), Tim Burchett (Tenn.), Eli Crane (Ariz.), Bob Good (Va.), Ralph Norman (S.C.), Matt Rosendale (Mont.) and Chip Roy (Texas) joined Gaetz and Scalise in opposition.
Tuesday’s events could have far-ranging implications for GOP leaders in the weeks and months ahead, when they’re hoping to pass a number of their priorities through the House, including energy policy and tax reform. While Democrats had crossed the aisle to help McCarthy pass the rule governing the debt ceiling package, that vote was an anomaly, fueled by Biden’s endorsement of the package and the underlying urgency of preventing a default. 
Democrats are certain to unanimously oppose rules in the future — particularly on partisan GOP bills — empowering just a handful of conservatives to block the entirety of the Republican agenda into the indefinite future. Some suggested they’re ready to do just that.


  

“What we plan to do is to be ready at all points in time, acting in good faith, to reforge the unity that was destroyed last week. And so what happens depends on what — leadership is inclined to reciprocate and proceed,” Bishop told reporters.
“Every single thing about this is about how are we going to proceed to move the priorities for the American people,” Roy said. “That is literally what the question is on the table. And whatever is gonna be brought forward next — is it gonna be tomorrow, later this week, next Monday, Tuesday — what rule is gonna be brought forward and who’s deciding? And we think that we ought to be doing it the way we were doing it for five months successfully, and we think we ought to restore that.”
“But it’s gonna take a lot to restore our faith that we can do that in light of what happened with the debt limit,” he added.


  

At the center of the clash was Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), who has been embroiled in a back-and-forth with Scalise over the Georgia Republican’s legislation regarding a pistol stabilizing brace.
Clyde alleged that leadership threatened to block his bill from receiving a vote on the floor if he opposed the rule on the debt ceiling bill. On Tuesday morning, Scalise said he had a conversation with Clyde about problems the bill would face because of Republican opposition to the measure. He said, however, that GOP leadership was “working hard” to get the legislation passed.
Following that response, Clyde doubled down.


  

“Let me be unequivocally clear, I was threatened that if I voted against the closed rule to the debt ceiling agreement, it would be very difficult to bring my pistol stabilizing brace bill to the House floor vote a vote,” he said.
“Over the last few days, I have had several positive conversations with leadership about getting a vote on my bill next week, and it is my intention to hold them to that commitment,” he added.
While Clyde voted in favor of the rule Tuesday, other conservatives leaned on his clash with leadership to justify their dramatic protest. During Tuesday’s vote, Gaetz said he was “very aggrieved at the punishment that was delivered to” Clyde for his vote on the debt ceiling bill. 


  

“We’re not gonna live in a system where our members are subject to this type of petty punishment, and we’re not gonna live in a system where our constituents are left abandoned by anyone here in the Congress,” he added. “And rendering that type of punishment is certainly — it’s debasing to the institution.”
It’s unclear, however, what the conservatives are demanding that would break their opposition. 
The compromise bill infuriated the ideological fringes of both parties — a dynamic McCarthy has readily acknowledged — but the Speaker has also characterized that opposition as evidence of a successful deal in divided Washington.

“I think it only proves that the bill was right,” McCarthy told reporters in the Capitol on Monday night. 
McCarthy has suggested the debt ceiling debate would be a template for the must-pass bipartisan bills to come, including legislation to fund the government and prevent a government shutdown. Tuesday’s revolt on the House floor, however, raises new questions about whether he can tap that strategy and keep his Speakership.

House conservatives Tuesday blew up an effort by GOP leadership to advance several bills in a dramatic confrontation on the House floor, the result of a revolt against the debt limit deal cut by Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and President Biden just days earlier.
Eleven Republicans — most of whom are members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus — joined Democrats in voting against a rule to advance four bills related to gas stoves and regulatory reform, enough opposition to tank the rule and block the legislation from advancing to the floor.


  

Just before the vote closed, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) changed his vote to oppose the rule as well, a move that allows him to bring up the rule for another vote at a later time. The rule was blocked by a final vote of 206-220.
The revolt made for a dramatic scene on the House floor, where Scalise huddled with more than a dozen conservatives in the back of the chamber in a tense effort to flip votes and allow the bills to advance to the floor.
The normally-routine rule vote — which was scheduled to be only five minutes — went on for more than 50.
The revolt was also a reality check for McCarthy, who has been taking a victory lap after Congress passed and Biden signed a bill to suspend the debt limit that was the product of negotiations between House Republicans and the White House.
“We’re frustrated at the way this place is operating,” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) — one of the conservatives who voted against the rule — told reporters as the vote was still happening.
“We took a stand in January to end the era of the imperial Speakership, and we’re concerned that the fundamental commitments that allowed Kevin McCarthy to assume the Speakership have been violated as a consequence of the debt limit deal. And, you know, the answer for us is to reassert House conservatives as the appropriate coalition partner for our leadership, instead of them making common cause with Democrats,” he added.

Republican Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Dan Bishop (N.C.), Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Ken Buck (Colo.), Tim Burchett (Tenn.), Eli Crane (Ariz.), Bob Good (Va.), Ralph Norman (S.C.), Matt Rosendale (Mont.) and Chip Roy (Texas) joined Gaetz and Scalise in opposition.
Tuesday’s events could have far-ranging implications for GOP leaders in the weeks and months ahead, when they’re hoping to pass a number of their priorities through the House, including energy policy and tax reform. While Democrats had crossed the aisle to help McCarthy pass the rule governing the debt ceiling package, that vote was an anomaly, fueled by Biden’s endorsement of the package and the underlying urgency of preventing a default. 
Democrats are certain to unanimously oppose rules in the future — particularly on partisan GOP bills — empowering just a handful of conservatives to block the entirety of the Republican agenda into the indefinite future. Some suggested they’re ready to do just that.


  

“What we plan to do is to be ready at all points in time, acting in good faith, to reforge the unity that was destroyed last week. And so what happens depends on what — leadership is inclined to reciprocate and proceed,” Bishop told reporters.
“Every single thing about this is about how are we going to proceed to move the priorities for the American people,” Roy said. “That is literally what the question is on the table. And whatever is gonna be brought forward next — is it gonna be tomorrow, later this week, next Monday, Tuesday — what rule is gonna be brought forward and who’s deciding? And we think that we ought to be doing it the way we were doing it for five months successfully, and we think we ought to restore that.”
“But it’s gonna take a lot to restore our faith that we can do that in light of what happened with the debt limit,” he added.


  

At the center of the clash was Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), who has been embroiled in a back-and-forth with Scalise over the Georgia Republican’s legislation regarding a pistol stabilizing brace.
Clyde alleged that leadership threatened to block his bill from receiving a vote on the floor if he opposed the rule on the debt ceiling bill. On Tuesday morning, Scalise said he had a conversation with Clyde about problems the bill would face because of Republican opposition to the measure. He said, however, that GOP leadership was “working hard” to get the legislation passed.
Following that response, Clyde doubled down.


  

“Let me be unequivocally clear, I was threatened that if I voted against the closed rule to the debt ceiling agreement, it would be very difficult to bring my pistol stabilizing brace bill to the House floor vote a vote,” he said.
“Over the last few days, I have had several positive conversations with leadership about getting a vote on my bill next week, and it is my intention to hold them to that commitment,” he added.
While Clyde voted in favor of the rule Tuesday, other conservatives leaned on his clash with leadership to justify their dramatic protest. During Tuesday’s vote, Gaetz said he was “very aggrieved at the punishment that was delivered to” Clyde for his vote on the debt ceiling bill. 


  

“We’re not gonna live in a system where our members are subject to this type of petty punishment, and we’re not gonna live in a system where our constituents are left abandoned by anyone here in the Congress,” he added. “And rendering that type of punishment is certainly — it’s debasing to the institution.”
It’s unclear, however, what the conservatives are demanding that would break their opposition. 
The compromise bill infuriated the ideological fringes of both parties — a dynamic McCarthy has readily acknowledged — but the Speaker has also characterized that opposition as evidence of a successful deal in divided Washington.

A federal judge Tuesday granted media organizations’ requests to unseal the names of the people who cosigned Rep. George Santos’s (R-N.Y.) $500,000 bond in his criminal fraud case.
The order is a blow to Santos, whose attorney Monday asked a judge to keep the names of the bond cosigners sealed. The congressman’s lawyer, Joseph Murray, expressed concern for the sponsors should their identities be revealed, citing a “media frenzy” around the Santos case.


  

“If this Court is so inclined to unseal the sureties, we truly fear for their health, safety and well being,” Murray said.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Anne Shields gave Santos until noon Friday to appeal the ruling, ordering the names to remain under seal in the meantime.
Murray previously indicated Santos would rather go to jail ahead of trial rather than allow the suretors to face the public attention.
“My client would rather surrender to pretrial detainment than subject these suretors to what will inevitably come,” Murray said.
Federal prosecutors took no position on the unsealing request.
The Hill has reached out to Murray for comment.


  

Santos declined to comment when reached in the Capitol on Tuesday, and would not say if he plans to appeal the ruling. Asked why it is so important to protect the identities of the cosigners, he responded, “because it is.”

Santos faces 13 criminal charges over three alleged schemes that accuse him of misleading campaign donors, fraudulently receiving unemployment benefits and lying on financial disclosures. He pleaded not guilty and was released ahead of trial on the $500,000 bond.


  

The congressman has been at the center of a political firestorm since before he was sworn into office amid questions about his finances and biography. He faces calls to resign and to be expelled but has remained adamant that he does not plan to step down from Congress.
The controversy surrounding him escalated last month when the House voted to refer a resolution to expel Santos to the House Ethics Committee, punting on the question of whether or not the New York Republican should remain in office.
The vote, however, was largely redundant, since the Ethics panel has been investigating Santos since March. In a statement that month, the committee said it was looking into whether Santos “engaged in unlawful activity with respect to his 2022 congressional campaign; failed to properly disclose required information on statements filed with the House; violated federal conflict of interest laws in connection with his role in a firm providing fiduciary services; and/or engaged in sexual misconduct towards an individual seeking employment in his congressional office.”


  

Last month, the panel asked for information on the individuals who sponsored Santos’s bond.



		George Santos asks judge to keep sealed names of bail sponsors	


The request — outlined in a letter dated May 13 that was first made public Monday — asks Santos to identify the individuals who co-signed his bond, inform the committee of any payments made on his behalf to the co-signers as compensation, lay out any exceptions to House rules that the congressman believes applies to the bond guarantors and provide all documents related to the bond, including communications with the co-signers.
In a May 31 letter — the deadline set by the panel — Santos’s attorney, Joseph Murray, requested that the congressman receive a 30-day extension to respond to the committee’s request while noting that he was unable to share the requested information with the panel until it is unsealed by the court.


  

He said, however, that if the court ultimately decides to unseal the identities of the sureties and relevant documentation — which it did Tuesday — he would share the information with the panel.
“Please understand that unless or until such time that the Court unseals the identities of the suretors, the surety records, and proceedings, I cannot share that information with this Honorable House Ethics Committee,” Murray told the committee.
“If the Court decides to unseal the identities of the sureties, the surety records and proceedings, I will share that information with the Committee. If, however, the Court upholds the sealing, I will also share that Order with this Committee,” he added.


  

Murray did, however, cite the House rules definition of a “gift,” arguing that his bond fits that description.
“Under this definition the surety co-signer of an unsecured appearance bond may be considered a ‘favor’ or ‘other item having monetary value,’” he wrote.
He also outlined the rule that says gift restrictions do not apply to relatives.


  

Murray said Santos has conducted himself in an ethical manner as it pertains to the suretors of his bond. His letter also referenced exceptions for gifts given by relatives.
“I firmly believe that Congressman Santos has conducted himself honorably, lawfully, and ethically in keeping with the good order and finest traditions of an honorable members of the United States House of Representatives, in the manner in which the suretors who cosigned the unsecured $500,000.00 appearance bond, under oath in court were engaged,” Murray said.

a federal judge tuesday granted media organizations’ requests to unseal the names of the people who cosigned rep george santos’s rny 500000 bond in his criminal fraud case
the order is a blow to santos whose attorney monday asked a judge to keep the names of the bond cosigners sealed the congressman’s lawyer joseph murray expressed concern for the sponsors should their identities be revealed citing a “media frenzy” around the santos case


  

“if this court is so inclined to unseal the sureties we truly fear for their health safety and well being” murray said
us magistrate judge anne shields gave santos until noon friday to appeal the ruling ordering the names to remain under seal in the meantime
murray previously indicated santos would rather go to jail ahead of trial rather than allow the suretors to face the public attention
“my client would rather surrender to pretrial detainment than subject these suretors to what will inevitably come” murray said
federal prosecutors took no position on the unsealing request
the hill has reached out to murray for comment


  

santos declined to comment when reached in the capitol on tuesday and would not say if he plans to appeal the ruling asked why it is so important to protect the identities of the cosigners he responded “because it is”

rep george santos rny speaks to reporters outside after an effort to expel him from the house at the capitol in washington may 17 2023 ap photoj scott applewhite file
santos faces 13 criminal charges over three alleged schemes that accuse him of misleading campaign donors fraudulently receiving unemployment benefits and lying on financial disclosures he pleaded not guilty and was released ahead of trial on the 500000 bond


  

the congressman has been at the center of a political firestorm since before he was sworn into office amid questions about his finances and biography he faces calls to resign and to be expelled but has remained adamant that he does not plan to step down from congress
the controversy surrounding him escalated last month when the house voted to refer a resolution to expel santos to the house ethics committee punting on the question of whether or not the new york republican should remain in office
the vote however was largely redundant since the ethics panel has been investigating santos since march in a statement that month the committee said it was looking into whether santos “engaged in unlawful activity with respect to his 2022 congressional campaign failed to properly disclose required information on statements filed with the house violated federal conflict of interest laws in connection with his role in a firm providing fiduciary services andor engaged in sexual misconduct towards an individual seeking employment in his congressional office”


  

last month the panel asked for information on the individuals who sponsored santos’s bond

the requestoutlined in a letter dated may 13 that was first made public monday — asks santos to identify the individuals who cosigned his bond inform the committee of any payments made on his behalf to the cosigners as compensation lay out any exceptions to house rules that the congressman believes applies to the bond guarantors and provide all documents related to the bond including communications with the cosigners
in a may 31 letter — the deadline set by the panel — santos’s attorney joseph murray requested that the congressman receive a 30day extension to respond to the committee’s request while noting that he was unable to share the requested information with the panel until it is unsealed by the court


  

he said however that if the court ultimately decides to unseal the identities of the sureties and relevant documentation — which it did tuesdayhe would share the information with the panel
“please understand that unless or until such time that the court unseals the identities of the suretors the surety records and proceedings i cannot share that information with this honorable house ethics committee” murray told the committee
“if the court decides to unseal the identities of the sureties the surety records and proceedings i will share that information with the committee if however the court upholds the sealing i will also share that order with this committee” he added


  

murray did however cite the house rules definition of a “gift” arguing that his bond fits that description
“under this definition the surety cosigner of an unsecured appearance bond may be considered a ‘favor’ or ‘other item having monetary value’” he wrote
he also outlined the rule that says gift restrictions do not apply to relatives


  

murray said santos has conducted himself in an ethical manner as it pertains to the suretors of his bond his letter also referenced exceptions for gifts given by relatives
“i firmly believe that congressman santos has conducted himself honorably lawfully and ethically in keeping with the good order and finest traditions of an honorable members of the united states house of representatives in the manner in which the suretors who cosigned the unsecured 50000000 appearance bond under oath in court were engaged” murray said

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson (R) signed legislation Wednesday that will prevent transgender minors from accessing gender-affirming medical care and bar transgender women and girls from competing on female sports teams.
Both laws will take effect in August.


  

Missouri’s Senate Bill 49, the ban on gender-affirming care, will prohibit health care providers in the state from administering medications including puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy to treat gender dysphoria in minors, with an exception carved out for transgender youths who began treatment before the law’s effective date of Aug. 28.
The measure also bars transgender children and teenagers younger than 18 from receiving gender-affirming surgeries.
“We support everyone’s right to his or her own pursuit of happiness; however, we must protect children from making life-altering decisions that they could come to regret in adulthood once they have physically and emotionally matured,” Parson said in a statement Wednesday.
“These decisions have permanent consequences for life and should not be made by impressionable children who may be in crisis or influenced by the political persuasions of others,” he added.
Missouri joins 19 other states that have enacted laws or policies that heavily restrict or ban gender-affirming health care, 17 of which have done so this year. Gender-affirming care is considered medically necessary by every major medical organization.
Health care providers who violate the new law will have their professional licenses revoked, according to the bill, which also states that administering gender-affirming medical care to a minor “shall be considered grounds for a cause of action against the health care provider” — meaning young patients may more easily sue their doctors.


  

The new law additionally prohibits MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program, from covering transition-related procedures and prevents Missouri prisons, jails and correctional centers from providing gender-affirming medical care to transgender inmates, regardless of their age.
The bill, which passed the Missouri House in May, hit several initial stumbling blocks after its introduction in the state Senate in January, despite a Republican supermajority in the upper chamber. A filibuster effort led by Senate Democrats brought floor action to a screeching halt for several days in March, causing frustrated Republican leadership to adjourn for a scheduled spring break a full day early.
Parson in April threatened to keep lawmakers working beyond the state’s regular legislative session, which ended May 30, if they did not pass Senate Bill 49 and Senate Bill 39, the transgender athlete ban.


  

Both measures were only able to advance through the state Senate after hours of closed-door negotiations between party leaders and an agreement that each law will contain a sunset clause causing each measure to expire after four years. This means both laws would lapse on August 28, 2027.
In an email, state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican and the sponsor of the gender-affirming health care ban, said he hopes to remove his bill’s sunset clause before it expires.
“The reason the clause was added is the democrats wanted it and the republican leadership didn’t want to invest the effort necessary to oppose it,” he wrote. “In the end, though, I can only blame myself.”


  

Parson’s signature on Moon’s bill is the latest in a series of steps Missouri officials have taken this year to restrict access to gender-affirming health care for the state’s transgender youth and adults.
In April, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is facing reelection, put into effect an emergency regulation claiming gender-affirming medical care for minors is already illegal under a state law that prohibits certain medical interventions in the absence of “substantial guardrails.”
Bailey’s order, however, included stringent restrictions on care for transgender adults, in addition to children. Among other provisions, the order required that individuals must exhibit at least three years of “a medically documented, long-lasting, persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria” to qualify for care.

The emergency rule was abruptly terminated last month.
In February, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced that his office had launched an investigation into a St. Louis pediatric transgender clinic, after a first-person account from a former employee at the clinic alleged years of malpractice.
Bailey’s office has also launched an investigation into the clinic based on the ex-employee’s account, which has been challenged by reporting from the St. Louis Dispatch. Nearly two dozen parents of children seen at the clinic told the outlet that the allegations are “just not true.”

Former Vice President Mike Pence launched his 2024 presidential campaign Wednesday by sharply breaking with former President Donald Trump, laying out clear differences on policy and values and arguing that Trump’s push to overturn the 2020 election should be disqualifying.
Pence, speaking to a crowd of supporters in Ankeny, Iowa, offered his clearest rationale yet for why he is challenging his old running mate for the Republican nomination. Pence accused Trump of wavering on conservative policy priorities such as curtailing abortion access and balancing the budget and bemoaned Trump’s brand of politics as too divisive.


  

The former vice president also focused extensively on the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election, with some chanting, “Hang Mike Pence.”
The day marked a turning point in Pence’s relationship with his old boss, and Wednesday he argued Trump’s attempts to overturn the election — and his request for Pence to violate the Constitution in the process — make him unfit for office.
“The American people deserve to know on that fateful day, President Trump also demanded I choose between him and our Constitution,” Pence said. “Now, voters will be faced with the same choice. I chose the Constitution, and I always will.”
“The American people must know that leaders in the Republican Party will keep our oath to support and defend the Constitution, even when it is not in our political interests,” Pence added. “One last word that in part brings us here today: I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States, and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again.”
In officially launching his campaign, Pence became the first vice president in modern times to challenge his old running mate for the party’s nomination.
Pence spent four years serving as a loyal cheerleader to Trump, defending him through a steady stream of scandals, vouching for his at-times unorthodox policy decisions and urging Americans in 2020 to give the Trump-Pence ticket four more years in office.


  

The balancing act Pence will attempt to walk was on display Wednesday, as he said he was “incredibly proud” of the accomplishments of the last administration, even as he sought to argue Trump should not be given another term.
He now faces an uphill battle to overtake Trump at a time when many GOP primary voters view Pence as a traitor for refusing to reject the 2020 election results. Others looking for a Trump alternative appear to be backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).
“Given my support for our record, it might be fair to ask why I am challenging my former running mate for the Republican nomination for president,” Pence said. “It begins with a promise I made to the American people and to almighty God, and ends with two different visions for the future of our party and the country.”


  

A CNN poll released late last month found Pence was the first choice of 6 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning primary voters, trailing Trump, who was the first choice of 53 percent of voters, and DeSantis, who was the first choice of 26 percent.
A Monmouth University poll released last week asked GOP voters who they’d like to see as the Republican nominee for president but did not give a list of names. Pence polled at 3 percent, well behind Trump (43 percent) and DeSantis (19 percent).
Pence and his team intend to lean into the former vice president’s lengthy and consistent conservative track record on foreign policy, trade, entitlement reform and abortion, hoping that message will resonate with GOP voters who want to win general elections, and more specifically with Iowa evangelicals who will participate in the first caucus on the primary calendar next winter.


  

Pence repeatedly needled Trump on Wednesday as he laid out some of the particulars of his agenda.
The former vice president has vowed to support legislation to restrict abortion access and called on states to do the same. On Wednesday, he said Trump treats the issue of abortion as “an inconvenience,” blaming the issue for Republican election losses.
Pence has called for “common sense” reforms to Social Security and Medicare to address the budget and the solvency of the programs, while Trump has urged Republicans to leave entitlements untouched.


  

“Addressing a looming debt crisis and long-term survival of Social Security and Medicare are less important than their short-term political fortunes,” Pence said Wednesday.

And Pence, who in his launch video earlier Wednesday said the country needed a leader to appeal to its “better angels,” argued plainly in Des Moines that Trump was not capable of being that leader.
“Most Americans treat each other with kindness and respect — even when we disagree. It’s not too much to ask our leaders to do the same,” Pence said. “It is clear that neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump share this belief, and neither of them intend to bring this nation together.”


  

Pence is slated to attend a CNN town hall Wednesday evening in Des Moines, followed by more events Thursday in the Hawkeye State. He will travel to New Hampshire on Friday for a rally in Derry for his first campaign event in the Granite State, which hosts the first Republican primary.

former vice president mike pence launched his 2024 presidential campaign wednesday by sharply breaking with former president donald trump laying out clear differences on policy and values and arguing that trump’s push to overturn the 2020 election should be disqualifying
pence speaking to a crowd of supporters in ankeny iowa offered his clearest rationale yet for why he is challenging his old running mate for the republican nomination pence accused trump of wavering on conservative policy priorities such as curtailing abortion access and balancing the budget and bemoaned trump’s brand of politics as too divisive


  

the former vice president also focused extensively on the events of jan 6 2021 when protrump rioters stormed the capitol trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election with some chanting “hang mike pence”
the day marked a turning point in pence’s relationship with his old boss and wednesday he argued trump’s attempts to overturn the electionand his request for pence to violate the constitution in the processmake him unfit for office
“the american people deserve to know on that fateful day president trump also demanded i choose between him and our constitution” pence said “now voters will be faced with the same choice i chose the constitution and i always will”
“the american people must know that leaders in the republican party will keep our oath to support and defend the constitution even when it is not in our political interests” pence added “one last word that in part brings us here today i believe that anyone who puts themselves over the constitution should never be president of the united states and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the constitution should never be president of the united states again”
in officially launching his campaign pence became the first vice president in modern times to challenge his old running mate for the party’s nomination
pence spent four years serving as a loyal cheerleader to trump defending him through a steady stream of scandals vouching for his attimes unorthodox policy decisions and urging americans in 2020 to give the trumppence ticket four more years in office


  

the balancing act pence will attempt to walk was on display wednesday as he said he was “incredibly proud” of the accomplishments of the last administration even as he sought to argue trump should not be given another term
he now faces an uphill battle to overtake trump at a time when many gop primary voters view pence as a traitor for refusing to reject the 2020 election results others looking for a trump alternative appear to be backing florida gov ron desantis r
“given my support for our record it might be fair to ask why i am challenging my former running mate for the republican nomination for president” pence said “it begins with a promise i made to the american people and to almighty god and ends with two different visions for the future of our party and the country”


  

a  poll released late last month found pence was the first choice of 6 percent of republican and republicanleaning primary voters trailing trump who was the first choice of 53 percent of voters and desantis who was the first choice of 26 percent
a monmouth university poll released last week asked gop voters who they’d like to see as the republican nominee for president but did not give a list of names pence polled at 3 percent well behind trump 43 percent and desantis 19 percent
pence and his team intend to lean into the former vice president’s lengthy and consistent conservative track record on foreign policy trade entitlement reform and abortion hoping that message will resonate with gop voters who want to win general elections and more specifically with iowa evangelicals who will participate in the first caucus on the primary calendar next winter


  

pence repeatedly needled trump on wednesday as he laid out some of the particulars of his agenda
the former vice president has vowed to support legislation to restrict abortion access and called on states to do the same on wednesday he said trump treats the issue of abortion as “an inconvenience” blaming the issue for republican election losses
pence has called for “common sense” reforms to social security and medicare to address the budget and the solvency of the programs while trump has urged republicans to leave entitlements untouched


  

“addressing a looming debt crisis and longterm survival of social security and medicare are less important than their shortterm political fortunes” pence said wednesday

		wildfire smoke makes weekend comeback as canadian fires rage 	

and pence who in his launch video earlier wednesday said the country needed a leader to appeal to its “better angels” argued plainly in des moines that trump was not capable of being that leader
“most americans treat each other with kindness and respecteven when we disagree it’s not too much to ask our leaders to do the same” pence said “it is clear that neither joe biden nor donald trump share this belief and neither of them intend to bring this nation together”


  

pence is slated to attend a  town hall wednesday evening in des moines followed by more events thursday in the hawkeye state he will travel to new hampshire on friday for a rally in derry for his first campaign event in the granite state which hosts the first republican primary

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that the CNN poll referenced was released on May 25.
Democrats are growing concerned that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s profile is rising just as President Biden embarks on a challenging campaign to keep the White House out of Republican control.


  

Kennedy, an anti-vaccine proponent who launched a primary bid against Biden this spring, is doing unexpectedly well in some polls and receiving increasing media attention as a result. He has also been on a press tour this week that included a Twitter Spaces discussion with Elon Musk and digital town hall with journalist Michael Smerconish.
Democrats widely consider Kennedy to be a problematic fringe candidate who freely spreads conspiracy theories. But his relatively decent poll numbers, as well as his media-ready image as an heir to the famous political dynasty, have caused some to worry he could gain steam and potentially distract from the task of reelecting Biden in 2024.
“Democrats would be foolish to mock or belittle RFK Jr. Every time we make fun of those who hold fringe positions, we lose,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist and former campaign aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “The Democratic Party acting smug never works.”
Kennedy has indeed stirred up some untapped anger within his own party; Democrats have seen him rise to double digits in several recent polls, leading some establishment figures to acknowledge the parts of his message that may be resonating with voters.

A recent Fox News survey placed Kennedy at 16 percent support among registered voters. And a CNN poll released on May 25 shows him with 20 percent of support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents.
“Take RFK seriously, Biden,” Ceraso said. “If you don’t, we can create a stronger Republican Party that beats us in 2024. Like Bernie did in 2016, RFK has the potential to activate fringe anger if we mock them.”


  

On Monday, the environmental lawyer made a series of unconventional campaign moves that caught the media’s attention. He participated in a SiriusXM-streamed interview with Smerconish, where he called himself an “an evidenced-based person” and doubled down on his nonconformist views on vaccines while defending his candidacy.
“It’s not like the Soviet system where the party would, you know, pick the candidates,” he said about his challenge to Biden, arguing that Americans need to see democracy in action.

After that, he participated in a Twitter Spaces conversation with Musk, where Kennedy spent portions of the discussion overtly praising him, including saying, “thank you for your service” of buying the platform. 
He even suggested that he would take a stricter approach to immigration that puts him closer to former President Trump, saying he is planning on looking into ways that “will seal the border permanently.”
At one point in the discussion, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party to become a Trump-aligned Republican after her own failed presidential bid in 2020, appeared in the online chat.  


  

Democrats have mostly waved off Kennedy’s campaign as a mere distraction. In recent days, however, some have become more upset and outright dismissive about his fondness for espousing theories about politics and science without credible evidence.  
“Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is able to generate media attention and a certain bit of curiosity because of his name. Otherwise he’s a gadfly and a laughingstock,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way.

Democrats have emphasized the danger of his disputed views toward vaccines after Republicans spent much of the pandemic spreading misinformation and contradicting public health officials.  


  

Some have alluded to Kennedy’s controversial views, such as school shootings being tied to Big Pharma, and coziness with figures such as Musk — Kennedy also picked up an endorsement from Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder, this week — as more befitting of a Republican.
“He’s in the wrong party to attract votes centering on COVID conspiracy theories, vaccine phobia and Putin adoration,” Kessler said. “There’s plenty of room at the inn for those views in the Republican Party. He should go there.”
While Kennedy’s profile has increased nationally, there are also conversations playing out in key states that could possibly impact the 2024 race. The early primary calendar changed this year after Biden urged the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to move South Carolina to be the first state, demoting Iowa and New Hampshire.

Many Democrats in New Hampshire have been outspoken about that move and have criticized Biden for lobbying for a change to the decades-long process. Some progressives in particular believe his decision could open up the pathway for a nontraditional candidate like Kennedy to earn an early-state win, despite the overall scorn from national Democrats about his bid.  
“I’m thankful RFK Jr. is bringing a democratic challenge to the stagnant political establishment,” said Cullen Tiernan, a New Hampshire-based labor activist who supported Sanders’s presidential bids, who added that the candidate “has a unique opportunity to tap into our collective imagination and the vision that we can do better.”
“Living in New Hampshire,” Tiernan continued, “I’m still processing that our sitting president would rather pretend we do not exist here than campaign and engage in retail politics and town hall-type questions from voters. It does not instill confidence in his ability to campaign in the general election.”


  

Tiernan is not alone in that view. Spiritual author and progressive Marianne Williamson, who is also competing against Biden for the nomination, has expressed similar sentiments, and Kennedy suggested that Biden’s fifth-place finish in the state during the last election has contributed to his apathy this time around. 
“He’s never done well in New Hampshire,” Kennedy said. “I think he did not want to compete in New Hampshire.”
There’s also the issue of debates. The DNC has declined to greenlight a live debate between Biden and any primary challengers, including Kennedy, who’s just over a decade younger than the president and hasn’t yet been tested in that format.  

President Biden is seen following a ceremony on the South Lawn of the Whtie House in Washington, D.C., to honor the Super Bowl LVII champions’ Kansas City Chiefs on Monday, June 5, 2023.
Biden has struggled to maintain high approval ratings during his first term in office, with some making the argument that others should be able to participate in debates against a president who’s had trouble sustaining voters’ enthusiasm. Discontent over Biden and Trump is also reflected in some polls showing high voter appetite for a potential third-party candidate, including a survey from NewsNation/DDHQ this week that showed nearly half of voters would consider such a candidate.
“I think it would be a disadvantage for him to debate me,” Kennedy said about Biden. “I don’t think the optics are good for the American people.”
Still, many Democrats say Kennedy is causing an unnecessary distraction in the early days of the election cycle. They hoped for a relatively easy ascent for Biden to nab the nomination, saving their manpower for a much tougher fight against the eventual Republican nominee in November.

“He’s cobbled together a small and weakly-held coalition of anti-vaxxers, disillusioned Democrats and people who remember his daddy’s name,” said Sawyer Hackett, a Democratic communications consultant and adviser to former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. 
“His message is largely incoherent, and he lacks the political heft to make any discernible impact in the race beyond being a gnat the Biden campaign is trying to ignore,” he said.

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that the CNN poll referenced was released on May 25.
Democrats are growing concerned that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s profile is rising just as President Biden embarks on a challenging campaign to keep the White House out of Republican control.


  

Kennedy, an anti-vaccine proponent who launched a primary bid against Biden this spring, is doing unexpectedly well in some polls and receiving increasing media attention as a result. He has also been on a press tour this week that included a Twitter Spaces discussion with Elon Musk and digital town hall with journalist Michael Smerconish.
Democrats widely consider Kennedy to be a problematic fringe candidate who freely spreads conspiracy theories. But his relatively decent poll numbers, as well as his media-ready image as an heir to the famous political dynasty, have caused some to worry he could gain steam and potentially distract from the task of reelecting Biden in 2024.
“Democrats would be foolish to mock or belittle RFK Jr. Every time we make fun of those who hold fringe positions, we lose,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist and former campaign aide to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “The Democratic Party acting smug never works.”
Kennedy has indeed stirred up some untapped anger within his own party; Democrats have seen him rise to double digits in several recent polls, leading some establishment figures to acknowledge the parts of his message that may be resonating with voters.

A recent Fox News survey placed Kennedy at 16 percent support among registered voters. And a CNN poll released on May 25 shows him with 20 percent of support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents.
“Take RFK seriously, Biden,” Ceraso said. “If you don’t, we can create a stronger Republican Party that beats us in 2024. Like Bernie did in 2016, RFK has the potential to activate fringe anger if we mock them.”


  

On Monday, the environmental lawyer made a series of unconventional campaign moves that caught the media’s attention. He participated in a SiriusXM-streamed interview with Smerconish, where he called himself an “an evidenced-based person” and doubled down on his nonconformist views on vaccines while defending his candidacy.
“It’s not like the Soviet system where the party would, you know, pick the candidates,” he said about his challenge to Biden, arguing that Americans need to see democracy in action.

After that, he participated in a Twitter Spaces conversation with Musk, where Kennedy spent portions of the discussion overtly praising him, including saying, “thank you for your service” of buying the platform. 
He even suggested that he would take a stricter approach to immigration that puts him closer to former President Trump, saying he is planning on looking into ways that “will seal the border permanently.”
At one point in the discussion, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party to become a Trump-aligned Republican after her own failed presidential bid in 2020, appeared in the online chat.  


  

Democrats have mostly waved off Kennedy’s campaign as a mere distraction. In recent days, however, some have become more upset and outright dismissive about his fondness for espousing theories about politics and science without credible evidence.  
“Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is able to generate media attention and a certain bit of curiosity because of his name. Otherwise he’s a gadfly and a laughingstock,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way.

Some have alluded to Kennedy’s controversial views, such as school shootings being tied to Big Pharma, and coziness with figures such as Musk — Kennedy also picked up an endorsement from Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder, this week — as more befitting of a Republican.
“He’s in the wrong party to attract votes centering on COVID conspiracy theories, vaccine phobia and Putin adoration,” Kessler said. “There’s plenty of room at the inn for those views in the Republican Party. He should go there.”
While Kennedy’s profile has increased nationally, there are also conversations playing out in key states that could possibly impact the 2024 race. The early primary calendar changed this year after Biden urged the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to move South Carolina to be the first state, demoting Iowa and New Hampshire.

Many Democrats in New Hampshire have been outspoken about that move and have criticized Biden for lobbying for a change to the decades-long process. Some progressives in particular believe his decision could open up the pathway for a nontraditional candidate like Kennedy to earn an early-state win, despite the overall scorn from national Democrats about his bid.  
“I’m thankful RFK Jr. is bringing a democratic challenge to the stagnant political establishment,” said Cullen Tiernan, a New Hampshire-based labor activist who supported Sanders’s presidential bids, who added that the candidate “has a unique opportunity to tap into our collective imagination and the vision that we can do better.”
“Living in New Hampshire,” Tiernan continued, “I’m still processing that our sitting president would rather pretend we do not exist here than campaign and engage in retail politics and town hall-type questions from voters. It does not instill confidence in his ability to campaign in the general election.”


  

Tiernan is not alone in that view. Spiritual author and progressive Marianne Williamson, who is also competing against Biden for the nomination, has expressed similar sentiments, and Kennedy suggested that Biden’s fifth-place finish in the state during the last election has contributed to his apathy this time around. 
“He’s never done well in New Hampshire,” Kennedy said. “I think he did not want to compete in New Hampshire.”
There’s also the issue of debates. The DNC has declined to greenlight a live debate between Biden and any primary challengers, including Kennedy, who’s just over a decade younger than the president and hasn’t yet been tested in that format.  

President Biden is seen following a ceremony on the South Lawn of the Whtie House in Washington, D.C., to honor the Super Bowl LVII champions’ Kansas City Chiefs on Monday, June 5, 2023.
Biden has struggled to maintain high approval ratings during his first term in office, with some making the argument that others should be able to participate in debates against a president who’s had trouble sustaining voters’ enthusiasm. Discontent over Biden and Trump is also reflected in some polls showing high voter appetite for a potential third-party candidate, including a survey from NewsNation/DDHQ this week that showed nearly half of voters would consider such a candidate.
“I think it would be a disadvantage for him to debate me,” Kennedy said about Biden. “I don’t think the optics are good for the American people.”
Still, many Democrats say Kennedy is causing an unnecessary distraction in the early days of the election cycle. They hoped for a relatively easy ascent for Biden to nab the nomination, saving their manpower for a much tougher fight against the eventual Republican nominee in November.

“He’s cobbled together a small and weakly-held coalition of anti-vaxxers, disillusioned Democrats and people who remember his daddy’s name,” said Sawyer Hackett, a Democratic communications consultant and adviser to former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro. 
“His message is largely incoherent, and he lacks the political heft to make any discernible impact in the race beyond being a gnat the Biden campaign is trying to ignore,” he said.

editor’s note this story has been updated to reflect that the  poll referenced was released on may 25
democrats are growing concerned that robert f kennedy jr’s profile is rising just as president biden embarks on a challenging campaign to keep the white house out of republican control


  

kennedy an antivaccine proponent who launched a primary bid against biden this spring is doing unexpectedly well in some polls and receiving increasing media attention as a result he has also been on a press tour this week that included a twitter spaces discussion with elon musk and digital town hall with journalist michael smerconish
democrats widely consider kennedy to be a problematic fringe candidate who freely spreads conspiracy theories but his relatively decent poll numbers as well as his mediaready image as an heir to the famous political dynasty have caused some to worry he could gain steam and potentially distract from the task of reelecting biden in 2024
“democrats would be foolish to mock or belittle rfk jr every time we make fun of those who hold fringe positions we lose” said michael ceraso a democratic strategist and former campaign aide to sen bernie sanders ivt and transportation secretary pete buttigieg “the democratic party acting smug never works”
kennedy has indeed stirred up some untapped anger within his own party democrats have seen him rise to double digits in several recent polls leading some establishment figures to acknowledge the parts of his message that may be resonating with voters

a recent  news survey placed kennedy at 16 percent support among registered voters and a  poll released on may 25 shows him with 20 percent of support among democratic and democraticleaning respondents
“take rfk seriously biden” ceraso said “if you don’t we can create a stronger republican party that beats us in 2024 like bernie did in 2016 rfk has the potential to activate fringe anger if we mock them”


  

on monday the environmental lawyer made a series of unconventional campaign moves that caught the media’s attention he participated in a siriusxmstreamed interview with smerconish where he called himself an “an evidencedbased person” and doubled down on his nonconformist views on vaccines while defending his candidacy
“it’s not like the soviet system where the party would you know pick the candidates” he said about his challenge to biden arguing that americans need to see democracy in action

after that he participated in a twitter spaces conversation with musk where kennedy spent portions of the discussion overtly praising him including saying “thank you for your service” of buying the platform 
he even suggested that he would take a stricter approach to immigration that puts him closer to former president trump saying he is planning on looking into ways that “will seal the border permanently”
at one point in the discussion former hawaii rep tulsi gabbard who left the democratic party to become a trumpaligned republican after her own failed presidential bid in 2020 appeared in the online chat  


  

democrats have mostly waved off kennedy’s campaign as a mere distraction in recent days however some have become more upset and outright dismissive about his fondness for espousing theories about politics and science without credible evidence  
“robert f kennedy jr is able to generate media attention and a certain bit of curiosity because of his name otherwise he’s a gadfly and a laughingstock” said jim kessler executive vice president for policy at third way

“he’s in the wrong party to attract votes centering on covid conspiracy theories vaccine phobia and putin adoration” kessler said “there’s plenty of room at the inn for those views in the republican party he should go there”
while kennedy’s profile has increased nationally there are also conversations playing out in key states that could possibly impact the 2024 race the early primary calendar changed this year after biden urged the democratic national committee dnc to move south carolina to be the first state demoting iowa and new hampshire

“i’m thankful rfk jr is bringing a democratic challenge to the stagnant political establishment” said cullen tiernan a new hampshirebased labor activist who supported sanders’s presidential bids who added that the candidate “has a unique opportunity to tap into our collective imagination and the vision that we can do better”
“living in new hampshire” tiernan continued “i’m still processing that our sitting president would rather pretend we do not exist here than campaign and engage in retail politics and town halltype questions from voters it does not instill confidence in his ability to campaign in the general election”


  

tiernan is not alone in that view spiritual author and progressive marianne williamson who is also competing against biden for the nomination has expressed similar sentiments and kennedy suggested that biden’s fifthplace finish in the state during the last election has contributed to his apathy this time around 
“he’s never done well in new hampshire” kennedy said “i think he did not want to compete in new hampshire”
there’s also the issue of debates the dnc has declined to greenlight a live debate between biden and any primary challengers including kennedy who’s just over a decade younger than the president and hasn’t yet been tested in that format  

president biden is seen following a ceremony on the south lawn of the whtie house in washington dc to honor the super bowl lvii champions’ kansas city chiefs on monday june 5 2023
biden has struggled to maintain high approval ratings during his first term in office with some making the argument that others should be able to participate in debates against a president who’s had trouble sustaining voters’ enthusiasm discontent over biden and trump is also reflected in some polls showing high voter appetite for a potential thirdparty candidate including a survey from newsnationddhq this week that showed nearly half of voters would consider such a candidate
“i think it would be a disadvantage for him to debate me” kennedy said about biden “i don’t think the optics are good for the american people”
still many democrats say kennedy is causing an unnecessary distraction in the early days of the election cycle they hoped for a relatively easy ascent for biden to nab the nomination saving their manpower for a much tougher fight against the eventual republican nominee in november

New spending limits created by the recently passed debt ceiling deal are already fueling divisions across party lines — and among factions of the House GOP.
Shortly after House members returned to Washington this week, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) rejected pressure from some Senate Republicans upset about curbing defense funding through the deal reached with President Biden. 


  

“This is the beef I have,” McCarthy said to reporters on Tuesday. “We just came to an agreement, and the first thing I hear over there, ‘I don’t want to vote for it. We need to supplemental,'” the speaker said, referring to a stand-alone bill to boost defense spending.
Asked about a Pentagon supplemental funding bill, McCarthy said: “Why would they start with that? … You’ve got [Sen.] Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and his only answer is more money for defense.”
His comments arrive on the heels of criticism leveled by some Senate Republicans, who have balked at defense levels set as part of the bipartisan bill, dubbed the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
The bill suspended the debt ceiling until 2025 to prevent a federal default in exchange for setting new limits on government funding and other measures to repeal previously allocated money.
Some Republicans have lauded reforms in the bill they say would allow for a significant cut to federal spending.
But Republican defense hawks have railed against the bill for including a penalty of automatic across-the-board cuts if lawmakers don’t finish their annual spending bills by the end of the calendar year.


  

Lawmakers haven’t met their annual funding deadline since 1997.
The bill passed the Senate late Thursday, but not until leaders from both sides of the Senate issued a joint statement into the congressional record clarifying the proposed caps would not block lawmakers from passing supplemental funding for defense in the event of an emergency.  
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told The Hill that if lawmakers were on track to fail to pass annual funding bills in time — which would trigger automatic cuts — leaders envisioned “passing an emergency defense appropriation bill to help the Department of Defense.”


  

“I think that’s at the heart of it and a good faith effort to bring all appropriation bills to the floor,” Durbin said.
Even so, some conservatives are already coming out against the idea of a supplemental funding bill for defense.
“I mean, the senators believe that it’s too aggressive. Well, that’s great news,” Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) said Tuesday of the spending cuts in the debt limit deal.


  

“I wish we could have pushed further. But the idea that they’re bristling at the caps that did pass says well, we might have got as much as we could achieve.”
Davidson, a former Army Ranger, also took aim at what he called “neoconservatives, which is a fancy word for not conservative, that want to find more wars in more places,” specifically naming Graham.
Other conservatives have also pressed for GOP leadership to hold the line, while raising concerns about opening the door to further spending outside the levels set in the recent bill. 


  

Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) said entertaining a supplemental funding bill “will cause a lot of other issues.”
Some Democrats have already signaled they’re prepared to pry open the door to more funding for domestic programs pared back in the debt bill if Republicans do so for defense funds.
Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said ahead of the bill’s passage that she was determined to “lessen the damage of these cuts at every possible opportunity,” which could include “working with the administration and my colleagues to consider a supplemental.”


  

“But that conversation has to consider more than just Defense and Ukraine because there are so many important priorities like border security, disaster relief, and other nondefense items that we should not let be shortchanged,” Murray said. 
Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, struck a similar note Tuesday while discussing if lawmakers look to a supplemental funding measure “would increase overall defense spending.”
“Unless there is a willingness to increase domestic spending at the same time, you know, we’ll just see,” she added.

As for now, Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.), ranking member of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, told The Hill on Tuesday that spending levels in the forthcoming defense funding bill will be in line with the recently passed debt limit bill. 
“The Senate is the Senate. All I know, here in the house, we’re gonna pass the bill we have,” he said, “and we’re going to try to do it as soon as possible.”

Florida officials are facing potential legal peril over GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis’s migrant relocation moves.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) and Bexar County (Texas) Sheriff Javier Salazar, whose jurisdiction encompasses San Antonio, are focusing their criminal and civil investigations on whether migrants were lured onto flights under false pretenses.


  

Salazar’s office filed charges with the local district attorney Monday after a nine-month investigation into a Florida-run operation that transported 49 migrants from San Antonio to Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. Bonta announced his own investigation over the weekend.
“I think deception is a key part of what’s happened here,” he told The Hill.

Both those investigations orbit DeSantis, former President Trump’s leading competitor for the 2024 GOP nomination, whose hard-line stance on immigration is a keystone of his campaign.
“Gov. DeSantis is abusing Florida taxpayer dollars. We welcome the federal government or other states to help us challenge these dangerous political stunts,” said Florida Rep. Darren Soto (D).
After remaining uncharacteristically quiet on the issue for days, DeSantis’s office Tuesday took ownership of the latest flights, which carried migrants from Texas to Sacramento, Calif.
“From left-leaning mayors in El Paso, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, the relocation of those illegally crossing the United States border is not new,” division of emergency management spokesperson Alecia Collins said in a statement. “But suddenly, when Florida sends illegal aliens to a sanctuary city, it’s false imprisonment and kidnapping.”


  

Collins’s statement and a video released by DeSantis’s office characterized the flights as voluntary — a rare defensive move from the Republican presidential candidate — amid increasingly vocal challenges from the West.

Bonta said he’s “glad the state of Florida is accepting blame for what they’ve done.”
“They have no choice but to – all the evidence pointed that way. It was obvious that it was them. They have a $10 [million] to $12 million budget outlay to pay for this program.”


  

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) panned DeSantis for the flights in a tweet Monday, calling him a “small, pathetic man” and floating the idea of leveling kidnapping charges over the flights.
At a Wednesday roundtable event on the border in Arizona, DeSantis declined to address either the migrant flights or Newsom’s criticism, but did assail so-called “sanctuary” cities and states on immigration.
“That’s the policies that they’ve staken out,” he said. “And then what? When they have to deal with some of the fruits of that, they all of a sudden become very, very upset about that.”


  

Bonta, who met Saturday with a group of migrants from the flights, said his investigation would cast a wide net.
“Everyone involved, anyone involved in the scheme and the movement of the 36 asylum seekers from El Paso to Sacramento with New Mexico in between, and that includes the state of Florida and its employees who are involved, and that includes any private entity,” he said.
Though Bonta and Newsom are the highest-profile Democrats to raise criminal charges as a possible counterpunch to migrant relocations, Salazar has for months been pursuing an investigation into the first Florida-related migrant flight.


  

“[DeSantis] took these people from my hometown of San Antonio. So, San Antonio was always going to have some kind of jurisdiction because of that, and the sheriff indicated a few months ago that he was going to do a full investigation,” said Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas).
“Our district attorney, I believe, will take a close look at [the investigation,] and if DeSantis and his crew committed what they’re accused of committing, then the district attorney will prosecute him.”
According to Salazar’s office, the recommended charges include several counts of unlawful restraint, some of which are misdemeanors and others felonies.


  

Gerardo Menchaca, an immigration lawyer in San Antonio who has advised some of the migrants who boarded the flights, said he believes the alleged deception amounts to kidnapping.
“It’s kidnapping if you lie to somebody to get them in the car with you and then take them to a place where it’s totally different than what you told them it was going to be,” he said. 
“These people were told, ‘Come on, and we’re going to get you a job.’ And then there’s an allegation of somebody being told, ‘We’ll expedite your work permit.’ So that is kidnapping, and also, there’s minors involved, so minors can’t even consent.”


  

Reactions from Bexar County and California stand in contrast to those of some big-city mayors including New York City’s Eric Adams (D), who condemned the practice of shipping migrants north but also butted heads with the Biden administration over funding for new arrivals.
“Whether it’s [former Chicago Mayor] Lori Lightfoot or Eric Adams, they turn around and say, ‘This is a stunt’ and then they say ‘We can’t take any more,'” said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist. 
“And when they say they can’t take any more, that’s when the Western Governors jump in. The Western Governors weren’t gonna say anything. This is their way of trying to stop the bleeding by turning the subject back on the Republicans, but when you look at the polling, more Americans are waking up.”
Polls on immigration issues generally show a deep partisan divide, though key polls have found large majorities of Americans disapprove of President Biden’s handling of the issue.
Many Democrats, though, push back on the Republican idea that disapproval of Biden’s handling of immigration equates to approval of hard-line policies such as migrant relocations.
“Democrats are rightly taking a stand on this because it’s disgusting,” said Kristian Ramos, a Democratic strategist.
“What’s particularly stupid about all of this is, in a general election, Democrats, moderate Democrats and independents are solidly pro-immigrant, so once the general election rolls around for these Republican candidates, they’re going to stop talking about this stuff.”

california gov gavin newsom d panned desantis for the flights in a tweet monday calling him a “small pathetic man” and floating the idea of leveling kidnapping charges over the flights
at a wednesday roundtable event on the border in arizona desantis declined to address either the migrant flights or newsom’s criticism but did assail socalled “sanctuary” cities and states on immigration
“that’s the policies that they’ve staken out” he said “and then what when they have to deal with some of the fruits of that they all of a sudden become very very upset about that”


  

bonta who met saturday with a group of migrants from the flights said his investigation would cast a wide net
“everyone involved anyone involved in the scheme and the movement of the 36 asylum seekers from el paso to sacramento with new mexico in between and that includes the state of florida and its employees who are involved and that includes any private entity” he said
though bonta and newsom are the highestprofile democrats to raise criminal charges as a possible counterpunch to migrant relocations salazar has for months been pursuing an investigation into the first floridarelated migrant flight


  

“desantis took these people from my hometown of san antonio so san antonio was always going to have some kind of jurisdiction because of that and the sheriff indicated a few months ago that he was going to do a full investigation” said rep joaquín castro dtexas
“our district attorney i believe will take a close look at the investigation and if desantis and his crew committed what they’re accused of committing then the district attorney will prosecute him”
according to salazar’s office the recommended charges include several counts of unlawful restraint some of which are misdemeanors and others felonies


  

gerardo menchaca an immigration lawyer in san antonio who has advised some of the migrants who boarded the flights said he believes the alleged deception amounts to kidnapping
“it’s kidnapping if you lie to somebody to get them in the car with you and then take them to a place where it’s totally different than what you told them it was going to be” he said 
“these people were told ‘come on and we’re going to get you a job’ and then there’s an allegation of somebody being told ‘we’ll expedite your work permit’ so that is kidnapping and also there’s minors involved so minors can’t even consent”


  

reactions from bexar county and california stand in contrast to those of some bigcity mayors including new york city’s eric adams d who condemned the practice of shipping migrants north but also butted heads with the biden administration over funding for new arrivals
“whether it’s former chicago mayor lori lightfoot or eric adams they turn around and say ‘this is a stunt’ and then they say ‘we can’t take any more” said ford o’connell a republican strategist 
“and when they say they can’t take any more that’s when the western governors jump in the western governors weren’t gonna say anything this is their way of trying to stop the bleeding by turning the subject back on the republicans but when you look at the polling more americans are waking up”
polls on immigration issues generally show a deep partisan divide though key polls have found large majorities of americans disapprove of president biden’s handling of the issue
many democrats though push back on the republican idea that disapproval of biden’s handling of immigration equates to approval of hardline policies such as migrant relocations
“democrats are rightly taking a stand on this because it’s disgusting” said kristian ramos a democratic strategist
“what’s particularly stupid about all of this is in a general election democrats moderate democrats and independents are solidly proimmigrant so once the general election rolls around for these republican candidates they’re going to stop talking about this stuff”

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson (R) signed legislation Wednesday that will prevent transgender minors from accessing gender-affirming medical care and bar transgender women and girls from competing on female sports teams.
Both laws will take effect in August.


  

Missouri’s Senate Bill 49, the ban on gender-affirming care, will prohibit health care providers in the state from administering medications including puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy to treat gender dysphoria in minors, with an exception carved out for transgender youths who began treatment before the law’s effective date of Aug. 28.
The measure also bars transgender children and teenagers younger than 18 from receiving gender-affirming surgeries.
“We support everyone’s right to his or her own pursuit of happiness; however, we must protect children from making life-altering decisions that they could come to regret in adulthood once they have physically and emotionally matured,” Parson said in a statement Wednesday.
“These decisions have permanent consequences for life and should not be made by impressionable children who may be in crisis or influenced by the political persuasions of others,” he added.
Missouri joins 19 other states that have enacted laws or policies that heavily restrict or ban gender-affirming health care, 17 of which have done so this year. Gender-affirming care is considered medically necessary by every major medical organization.
Health care providers who violate the new law will have their professional licenses revoked, according to the bill, which also states that administering gender-affirming medical care to a minor “shall be considered grounds for a cause of action against the health care provider” — meaning young patients may more easily sue their doctors.


  

The new law additionally prohibits MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program, from covering transition-related procedures and prevents Missouri prisons, jails and correctional centers from providing gender-affirming medical care to transgender inmates, regardless of their age.
The bill, which passed the Missouri House in May, hit several initial stumbling blocks after its introduction in the state Senate in January, despite a Republican supermajority in the upper chamber. A filibuster effort led by Senate Democrats brought floor action to a screeching halt for several days in March, causing frustrated Republican leadership to adjourn for a scheduled spring break a full day early.
Parson in April threatened to keep lawmakers working beyond the state’s regular legislative session, which ended May 30, if they did not pass Senate Bill 49 and Senate Bill 39, the transgender athlete ban.


  

Both measures were only able to advance through the state Senate after hours of closed-door negotiations between party leaders and an agreement that each law will contain a sunset clause causing each measure to expire after four years. This means both laws would lapse on August 28, 2027.
In an email, state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican and the sponsor of the gender-affirming health care ban, said he hopes to remove his bill’s sunset clause before it expires.
“The reason the clause was added is the democrats wanted it and the republican leadership didn’t want to invest the effort necessary to oppose it,” he wrote. “In the end, though, I can only blame myself.”


  

Parson’s signature on Moon’s bill is the latest in a series of steps Missouri officials have taken this year to restrict access to gender-affirming health care for the state’s transgender youth and adults.
In April, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is facing reelection, put into effect an emergency regulation claiming gender-affirming medical care for minors is already illegal under a state law that prohibits certain medical interventions in the absence of “substantial guardrails.”
Bailey’s order, however, included stringent restrictions on care for transgender adults, in addition to children. Among other provisions, the order required that individuals must exhibit at least three years of “a medically documented, long-lasting, persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria” to qualify for care.

The emergency rule was abruptly terminated last month.
In February, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced that his office had launched an investigation into a St. Louis pediatric transgender clinic, after a first-person account from a former employee at the clinic alleged years of malpractice.
Bailey’s office has also launched an investigation into the clinic based on the ex-employee’s account, which has been challenged by reporting from the St. Louis Dispatch. Nearly two dozen parents of children seen at the clinic told the outlet that the allegations are “just not true.”

Former Vice President Mike Pence launched his 2024 presidential campaign Wednesday by sharply breaking with former President Donald Trump, laying out clear differences on policy and values and arguing that Trump’s push to overturn the 2020 election should be disqualifying.
Pence, speaking to a crowd of supporters in Ankeny, Iowa, offered his clearest rationale yet for why he is challenging his old running mate for the Republican nomination. Pence accused Trump of wavering on conservative policy priorities such as curtailing abortion access and balancing the budget and bemoaned Trump’s brand of politics as too divisive.


  

The former vice president also focused extensively on the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election, with some chanting, “Hang Mike Pence.”
The day marked a turning point in Pence’s relationship with his old boss, and Wednesday he argued Trump’s attempts to overturn the election — and his request for Pence to violate the Constitution in the process — make him unfit for office.
“The American people deserve to know on that fateful day, President Trump also demanded I choose between him and our Constitution,” Pence said. “Now, voters will be faced with the same choice. I chose the Constitution, and I always will.”
“The American people must know that leaders in the Republican Party will keep our oath to support and defend the Constitution, even when it is not in our political interests,” Pence added. “One last word that in part brings us here today: I believe that anyone who puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States, and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again.”
In officially launching his campaign, Pence became the first vice president in modern times to challenge his old running mate for the party’s nomination.
Pence spent four years serving as a loyal cheerleader to Trump, defending him through a steady stream of scandals, vouching for his at-times unorthodox policy decisions and urging Americans in 2020 to give the Trump-Pence ticket four more years in office.


  

The balancing act Pence will attempt to walk was on display Wednesday, as he said he was “incredibly proud” of the accomplishments of the last administration, even as he sought to argue Trump should not be given another term.
He now faces an uphill battle to overtake Trump at a time when many GOP primary voters view Pence as a traitor for refusing to reject the 2020 election results. Others looking for a Trump alternative appear to be backing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).
“Given my support for our record, it might be fair to ask why I am challenging my former running mate for the Republican nomination for president,” Pence said. “It begins with a promise I made to the American people and to almighty God, and ends with two different visions for the future of our party and the country.”


  

A CNN poll released late last month found Pence was the first choice of 6 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning primary voters, trailing Trump, who was the first choice of 53 percent of voters, and DeSantis, who was the first choice of 26 percent.
A Monmouth University poll released last week asked GOP voters who they’d like to see as the Republican nominee for president but did not give a list of names. Pence polled at 3 percent, well behind Trump (43 percent) and DeSantis (19 percent).
Pence and his team intend to lean into the former vice president’s lengthy and consistent conservative track record on foreign policy, trade, entitlement reform and abortion, hoping that message will resonate with GOP voters who want to win general elections, and more specifically with Iowa evangelicals who will participate in the first caucus on the primary calendar next winter.


  

Pence repeatedly needled Trump on Wednesday as he laid out some of the particulars of his agenda.
The former vice president has vowed to support legislation to restrict abortion access and called on states to do the same. On Wednesday, he said Trump treats the issue of abortion as “an inconvenience,” blaming the issue for Republican election losses.
Pence has called for “common sense” reforms to Social Security and Medicare to address the budget and the solvency of the programs, while Trump has urged Republicans to leave entitlements untouched.


  

“Addressing a looming debt crisis and long-term survival of Social Security and Medicare are less important than their short-term political fortunes,” Pence said Wednesday.

		Wildfire smoke makes weekend comeback as Canadian fires rage 	

And Pence, who in his launch video earlier Wednesday said the country needed a leader to appeal to its “better angels,” argued plainly in Des Moines that Trump was not capable of being that leader.
“Most Americans treat each other with kindness and respect — even when we disagree. It’s not too much to ask our leaders to do the same,” Pence said. “It is clear that neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump share this belief, and neither of them intend to bring this nation together.”


  

Pence is slated to attend a CNN town hall Wednesday evening in Des Moines, followed by more events Thursday in the Hawkeye State. He will travel to New Hampshire on Friday for a rally in Derry for his first campaign event in the Granite State, which hosts the first Republican primary.

“the american people deserve to know on that fateful day president trump also demanded i choose between him and our constitution” pence said “now voters will be faced with the same choice i chose the constitution and i always will”
“the american people must know that leaders in the republican party will keep our oath to support and defend the constitution even when it is not in our political interests” pence added “one last word that in part brings us here today i believe that anyone who puts themselves over the constitution should never be president of the united states and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the constitution should never be president of the united states again”
in officially launching his campaign pence became the first vice president in modern times to challenge his old running mate for the party’s nomination
pence spent four years serving as a loyal cheerleader to trump defending him through a steady stream of scandals vouching for his attimes unorthodox policy decisions and urging americans in 2020 to give the trumppence ticket four more years in office


  

the balancing act pence will attempt to walk was on display wednesday as he said he was “incredibly proud” of the accomplishments of the last administration even as he sought to argue trump should not be given another term
he now faces an uphill battle to overtake trump at a time when many gop primary voters view pence as a traitor for refusing to reject the 2020 election results others looking for a trump alternative appear to be backing florida gov ron desantis r
“given my support for our record it might be fair to ask why i am challenging my former running mate for the republican nomination for president” pence said “it begins with a promise i made to the american people and to almighty god and ends with two different visions for the future of our party and the country”


  

a  poll released late last month found pence was the first choice of 6 percent of republican and republicanleaning primary voters trailing trump who was the first choice of 53 percent of voters and desantis who was the first choice of 26 percent
a monmouth university poll released last week asked gop voters who they’d like to see as the republican nominee for president but did not give a list of names pence polled at 3 percent well behind trump 43 percent and desantis 19 percent
pence and his team intend to lean into the former vice president’s lengthy and consistent conservative track record on foreign policy trade entitlement reform and abortion hoping that message will resonate with gop voters who want to win general elections and more specifically with iowa evangelicals who will participate in the first caucus on the primary calendar next winter


  

pence repeatedly needled trump on wednesday as he laid out some of the particulars of his agenda
the former vice president has vowed to support legislation to restrict abortion access and called on states to do the same on wednesday he said trump treats the issue of abortion as “an inconvenience” blaming the issue for republican election losses
pence has called for “common sense” reforms to social security and medicare to address the budget and the solvency of the programs while trump has urged republicans to leave entitlements untouched


  

“addressing a looming debt crisis and longterm survival of social security and medicare are less important than their shortterm political fortunes” pence said wednesday

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson (R) signed legislation Wednesday that will prevent transgender minors from accessing gender-affirming medical care and bar transgender women and girls from competing on female sports teams.
Both laws will take effect in August.


  

Missouri’s Senate Bill 49, the ban on gender-affirming care, will prohibit health care providers in the state from administering medications including puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy to treat gender dysphoria in minors, with an exception carved out for transgender youths who began treatment before the law’s effective date of Aug. 28.
The measure also bars transgender children and teenagers younger than 18 from receiving gender-affirming surgeries.
“We support everyone’s right to his or her own pursuit of happiness; however, we must protect children from making life-altering decisions that they could come to regret in adulthood once they have physically and emotionally matured,” Parson said in a statement Wednesday.
“These decisions have permanent consequences for life and should not be made by impressionable children who may be in crisis or influenced by the political persuasions of others,” he added.
Missouri joins 19 other states that have enacted laws or policies that heavily restrict or ban gender-affirming health care, 17 of which have done so this year. Gender-affirming care is considered medically necessary by every major medical organization.
Health care providers who violate the new law will have their professional licenses revoked, according to the bill, which also states that administering gender-affirming medical care to a minor “shall be considered grounds for a cause of action against the health care provider” — meaning young patients may more easily sue their doctors.


  

The new law additionally prohibits MO HealthNet, the state’s Medicaid program, from covering transition-related procedures and prevents Missouri prisons, jails and correctional centers from providing gender-affirming medical care to transgender inmates, regardless of their age.
The bill, which passed the Missouri House in May, hit several initial stumbling blocks after its introduction in the state Senate in January, despite a Republican supermajority in the upper chamber. A filibuster effort led by Senate Democrats brought floor action to a screeching halt for several days in March, causing frustrated Republican leadership to adjourn for a scheduled spring break a full day early.
Parson in April threatened to keep lawmakers working beyond the state’s regular legislative session, which ended May 30, if they did not pass Senate Bill 49 and Senate Bill 39, the transgender athlete ban.


  

Both measures were only able to advance through the state Senate after hours of closed-door negotiations between party leaders and an agreement that each law will contain a sunset clause causing each measure to expire after four years. This means both laws would lapse on August 28, 2027.
In an email, state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican and the sponsor of the gender-affirming health care ban, said he hopes to remove his bill’s sunset clause before it expires.
“The reason the clause was added is the democrats wanted it and the republican leadership didn’t want to invest the effort necessary to oppose it,” he wrote. “In the end, though, I can only blame myself.”


  

Parson’s signature on Moon’s bill is the latest in a series of steps Missouri officials have taken this year to restrict access to gender-affirming health care for the state’s transgender youth and adults.
In April, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who is facing reelection, put into effect an emergency regulation claiming gender-affirming medical care for minors is already illegal under a state law that prohibits certain medical interventions in the absence of “substantial guardrails.”
Bailey’s order, however, included stringent restrictions on care for transgender adults, in addition to children. Among other provisions, the order required that individuals must exhibit at least three years of “a medically documented, long-lasting, persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria” to qualify for care.

The emergency rule was abruptly terminated last month.
In February, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) announced that his office had launched an investigation into a St. Louis pediatric transgender clinic, after a first-person account from a former employee at the clinic alleged years of malpractice.
Bailey’s office has also launched an investigation into the clinic based on the ex-employee’s account, which has been challenged by reporting from the St. Louis Dispatch. Nearly two dozen parents of children seen at the clinic told the outlet that the allegations are “just not true.”

The late-stage presentation of evidence to a Florida grand jury is the latest sign that former President Trump may face trial in Miami as prosecutors work to insulate the Mar-a-Lago case from legal challenges stemming from the location of the proceedings.
Special counsel Jack Smith has for months been calling witnesses before a Washington, D.C., grand jury on the matter, but a recent flurry of activity in the case — just days after Trump’s attorneys met with Justice Department prosecutors in D.C. — has instead been in Florida.


  

This week, a handful of witnesses have been appearing in Florida, including Trump aide Taylor Budowich, who tweeted Wednesday that he was compelled to answer questions in the probe.
The move is a sign Smith is weighing filing charges there in addition to or instead of D.C., as defendants have a right to face trial where the alleged crime took place.

Determining the venue isn’t a low-stakes decision. A defendant can move to dismiss charges they believe haven’t been brought in the correct location.
“It signals that charges are likely to be in Florida, which also signals that I think the special counsel likely did not believe that he had venue for one or more of the charges in D.C.,” Brandon Van Grack, a former top national security lawyer with the Department of Justice (DOJ) who is now in private practice, told The Hill. 
But bringing the charges in Florida raises other considerations.


  

“For viewers who might be thinking, ‘Who cares as long as there are charges? Whether it’s D.C. or Florida, why does the venue matter?’ It really could make a huge difference. The jury pool is different. The judges are different,” Andrew Weissmann, who was one of the lead prosecutors on the Mueller investigation, said during an appearance on MSNBC.
“Also, D.C. is a location where the court is very used to dealing with classified information. There’s an expertise there. So in terms of speed, getting this case to trial, the venue matters.”

Trump’s legal team has been informed he is a target in the Mar-a-Lago probe, a move that usually precedes the filing of charges. 


  

Trump could face a multitude of charges in connection with the mishandling of records at Mar-a-Lago, including Espionage Act charges for willful retention of documents, as well as obstruction of justice charges stemming from the effort to keep them.
But while the effort to recover the documents stemmed from Washington — first from the National Archives and then from the DOJ — the timeline of the movement of the documents is at play in the case.
Trump’s legal team argued in a Supreme Court brief that he was still president while the boxes containing the classified documents were moved to Florida. 


  

If true, his team may be able to successfully argue to a judge that the conduct in question was initiated in the Sunshine State. 
Though the DOJ could try to make the case that Trump had involvement in the packing of the boxes during the D.C.-based transition, Van Grack notes that several circuits have determined that preparatory acts alone cannot be used to determine venue.
For obstruction of justice charges too, much of the activity appears to have occurred in Florida.


  

Prosecutors have zeroed in on a number of actions at Mar-a-Lago, from the failure to turn over all classified records following a subpoena last summer to video camera footage showing the movement of boxes in and out of a storage room.
A D.C. judge compelled testimony from Trump attorney Evan Corcoran after determining he may have been misled about how many documents remained at Mar-a-Lago. Corcoran returned 38 in response to the June 2022 subpoena, while the FBI found over 100 more when they searched the residence in August.

Judges can pierce attorney-client privilege if they believe legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime, and Corcoran has since recused himself from the case. 
Most recently, CNN reported that prosecutors have also been asking questions about the flooding of a room that housed servers of security footage after a Mar-a-Lago employee drained a pool. 
Obstruction charges in this case require proving a defendant knowingly concealed records and that they knowingly sought to impede an investigation. 


  

While subpoenas for the documents and video footage may have been issued in Washington, the D.C. circuit has held that the venue must be tied to where the unlawful conduct was committed.
On that front, prosecutors could be eyeing charges for more than just Trump.

DOJ officials have also been examining Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet who was spotted on security camera footage moving some of the boxes.
Timothy Parlatore, who until last month served as one of Trump’s attorneys in the matter and who has maintained the former president should not face charges in the probe, said there would be no basis for charging Nauta in D.C., and the same holds true for Trump.
“Ultimately, I haven’t seen anything in this case that would indicate that D.C. has jurisdiction. It’s something that when [top DOJ prosecutor] Jay Bratt opened the investigation, he started with a D.C. grand jury. I don’t think they had any basis to believe that there was jurisdiction in D.C. but that’s what he did. And that’s what Smith inherited,” Parlatore said.
“If they’re actually now getting down to where the rubber meets the road, they have to really consider, can they make out venue.”

It’s not entirely an either/or decision for Smith.
Prosecutors could bring different charges in different jurisdictions, trying Trump in two different cases.
Some see a benefit to bringing certain charges in D.C., where judges more routinely deal with classified information and some consider the jury pool to be more favorable to the DOJ.
On the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, prosecutors also noted they were investigating charges for concealment or removal of government records, a crime that requires showing a willful effort to keep the government from accessing its documents.

The charge could be one of the safest bets for bringing in D.C. 
“The existence of a separate grand jury in Florida considering evidence in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case strongly suggests that there may be *two* indictments due to venue issues, as there was in the [Paul] Manafort case,” Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, wrote on Twitter, referencing Trump’s former campaign manager.
“Certain potential crimes occurred *only* in Florida.”
But Van Grack said he doesn’t think that’s likely, given the DOJ’s own timeline considerations.
“It’s not that you can’t bring charges into different districts. But let’s also keep in mind, the special counsel, the Department of Justice has to try this case as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on the election. So the notion of bringing two different cases in two districts, I think would seem unlikely,” he said.
“You can do it. It delays things. It takes additional time. And I think it would be unlikely considering the time pressure that the Department of Justice is under to pursue that course.”
Weissmann wrote Thursday that the safest bet is to bring the case in Florida. 
“All else being equal, the prudent prosecutor will be reluctant to choose a venue where, if the government gets the venue decision wrong, it cannot proceed to try the defendant in another district for her crimes,” he wrote.
“Thus, although Florida may be a less advantageous district for the government — given its jury pool and its judges, who are less steeped in handling classified document cases … Florida is legally a less risky venue at this juncture.”

the latestage presentation of evidence to a florida grand jury is the latest sign that former president trump may face trial in miami as prosecutors work to insulate the maralago case from legal challenges stemming from the location of the proceedings
special counsel jack smith has for months been calling witnesses before a washington dc grand jury on the matter but a recent flurry of activity in the casejust days after trump’s attorneys met with justice department prosecutors in dchas instead been in florida


  

this week a handful of witnesses have been appearing in florida including trump aide taylor budowich who tweeted wednesday that he was compelled to answer questions in the probe
the move is a sign smith is weighing filing charges there in addition to or instead of dc as defendants have a right to face trial where the alleged crime took place

jack smith the department of justice’s chief of the public integrity section was the prosecutor named as special counsel to oversee investigations related to former president donald trump has a long career confronting public corruption and war crimes ap photocharles dharapak file
determining the venue isn’t a lowstakes decision a defendant can move to dismiss charges they believe haven’t been brought in the correct location
“it signals that charges are likely to be in florida which also signals that i think the special counsel likely did not believe that he had venue for one or more of the charges in dc” brandon van grack a former top national security lawyer with the department of justice doj who is now in private practice told the hill 
but bringing the charges in florida raises other considerations


  

“for viewers who might be thinking ‘who cares as long as there are charges whether it’s dc or florida why does the venue matter’ it really could make a huge difference the jury pool is different the judges are different” andrew weissmann who was one of the lead prosecutors on the mueller investigation said during an appearance on msnbc
“also dc is a location where the court is very used to dealing with classified information there’s an expertise there so in terms of speed getting this case to trial the venue matters”

trump’s legal team has been informed he is a target in the maralago probe a move that usually precedes the filing of charges 


  

trump could face a multitude of charges in connection with the mishandling of records at maralago including espionage act charges for willful retention of documents as well as obstruction of justice charges stemming from the effort to keep them
but while the effort to recover the documents stemmed from washingtonfirst from the national archives and then from the dojthe timeline of the movement of the documents is at play in the case
trump’s legal team argued in a supreme court brief that he was still president while the boxes containing the classified documents were moved to florida 


  

if true his team may be able to successfully argue to a judge that the conduct in question was initiated in the sunshine state 
though the doj could try to make the case that trump had involvement in the packing of the boxes during the dcbased transition van grack notes that several circuits have determined that preparatory acts alone cannot be used to determine venue
for obstruction of justice charges too much of the activity appears to have occurred in florida


  

prosecutors have zeroed in on a number of actions at maralago from the failure to turn over all classified records following a subpoena last summer to video camera footage showing the movement of boxes in and out of a storage room
a dc judge compelled testimony from trump attorney evan corcoran after determining he may have been misled about how many documents remained at maralago corcoran returned 38 in response to the june 2022 subpoena while the fbi found over 100 more when they searched the residence in august

judges can pierce attorneyclient privilege if they believe legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime and corcoran has since recused himself from the case 
most recently  reported that prosecutors have also been asking questions about the flooding of a room that housed servers of security footage after a maralago employee drained a pool 
obstruction charges in this case require proving a defendant knowingly concealed records and that they knowingly sought to impede an investigation 


  

while subpoenas for the documents and video footage may have been issued in washington the dc circuit has held that the venue must be tied to where the unlawful conduct was committed
on that front prosecutors could be eyeing charges for more than just trump

doj officials have also been examining walt nauta trump’s valet who was spotted on security camera footage moving some of the boxes
timothy parlatore who until last month served as one of trump’s attorneys in the matter and who has maintained the former president should not face charges in the probe said there would be no basis for charging nauta in dc and the same holds true for trump
“ultimately i haven’t seen anything in this case that would indicate that dc has jurisdiction it’s something that when top doj prosecutor jay bratt opened the investigation he started with a dc grand jury i don’t think they had any basis to believe that there was jurisdiction in dc but that’s what he did and that’s what smith inherited” parlatore said
“if they’re actually now getting down to where the rubber meets the road they have to really consider can they make out venue”

it’s not entirely an eitheror decision for smith
prosecutors could bring different charges in different jurisdictions trying trump in two different cases
some see a benefit to bringing certain charges in dc where judges more routinely deal with classified information and some consider the jury pool to be more favorable to the doj
on the warrant to search maralago prosecutors also noted they were investigating charges for concealment or removal of government records a crime that requires showing a willful effort to keep the government from accessing its documents

the charge could be one of the safest bets for bringing in dc 
“the existence of a separate grand jury in florida considering evidence in the maralago classified documents case strongly suggests that there may be two indictments due to venue issues as there was in the paul manafort case” renato mariotti a former federal prosecutor wrote on twitter referencing trump’s former campaign manager
“certain potential crimes occurred only in florida”
but van grack said he doesn’t think that’s likely given the doj’s own timeline considerations
“it’s not that you can’t bring charges into different districts but let’s also keep in mind the special counsel the department of justice has to try this case as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on the election so the notion of bringing two different cases in two districts i think would seem unlikely” he said
“you can do it it delays things it takes additional time and i think it would be unlikely considering the time pressure that the department of justice is under to pursue that course”
weissmann wrote thursday that the safest bet is to bring the case in florida 
“all else being equal the prudent prosecutor will be reluctant to choose a venue where if the government gets the venue decision wrong it cannot proceed to try the defendant in another district for her crimes” he wrote
“thus although florida may be a less advantageous district for the governmentgiven its jury pool and its judges who are less steeped in handling classified document cases … florida is legally a less risky venue at this juncture”

51,51,The Hill,Christina van Waasbergen,White House wants Native American health care funding baked into law,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4040669-white-house-wants-native-american-health-care-funding-baked-into-law/,2023-06-08T16:47:53Z,"On the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, which straddles the border between North and South Dakota, people line up at 6 a.m. in the freezing winter, hoping to get one of just four dental appointments… [+8409 chars]","

On the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, which straddles the border between North and South Dakota, people line up at 6 a.m. in the freezing winter, hoping to get one of just four dental appointments.
“If you don’t get those four, you’re out, you don’t get it,” said Janet Alkire, chairwoman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who described the scene at an April hearing of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs. 


  

And the lack of adequate medical care extends well beyond dental care, she told lawmakers. 
“Our babies cannot be born on our reservation,” she said. “Mothers have to leave their support networks, their families, sometimes the dads, definitely the grandmothers, behind and travel over 75 miles to deliver a baby.”
Through the Indian Health Service, the federal government provides free medical care for Native Americans, which the United States promised in various treaties with indigenous nations when it forced them from their lands in the mid-19th century. 
However, many Native Americans complain that the U.S. government breaks this promise by underfunding the Indian Health Service.
In order to solve this problem, the Biden administration wants to take Indian Health Service funding out of the annual budget negotiation process and instead have it baked into law. Its plan would culminate in around $44 billion in funding in fiscal 2033 — six times greater than current funding levels, but still short of what experts and advocates say is needed.
Indian Health Service funding has increased 68 percent in the past decade, culminating in $7.1 billion for the agency for fiscal 2023. But the agency’s funding is significantly less than other federal health care programs. In 2017, Indian Health Service spending per capita was less than half of that of the Veterans Health Administration and less than a third compared to Medicare, according to a report by the Government Accountability Office. 


  

The National Tribal Budget Formulation Workgroup, a group of Native American advocates and tribal representatives that advises the Indian Health Service on its annual budget request, estimates that nearly seven times more funding for the agency is needed to meet Native health care needs.
In her testimony, Alkire described the impact of this lack of adequate funding.
“The IHS hospital at Standing Rock is more than 60 years old,” she said. “It is falling apart and lacks space for life-saving equipment.”


  

“We recently purchased a CT scan (machine) with our own limited funds,” Alkire added. “There was no room, and we had to build it in the back entry to the building. But we do what we have to do, right?”
Such problems are not limited to that specific hospital. According to the Workgroup’s report on its fiscal 2024 budget recommendations, Indian Health Service hospitals have only 52 percent of the space needed based on the size of the population the agency cares for. Hospitals in Indian Country are also nearly four times older than the national average, the report says.
In its fiscal 2024 budget proposal, released in March, the Biden administration called for full mandatory funding for the Indian Health Service by fiscal 2025. The agency currently receives most of its funding through discretionary spending, which must be debated by Congress each year through the appropriations process. Programs like Medicare and Medicaid receive mandatory funding, meaning they’re automatically given a certain amount each year as determined by law. 


  

The White House is asking for $9.7 billion in total Indian Health Service funding for fiscal 2024, including $1.6 billion in proposed mandatory funding for certain expenses. By fiscal 2025, the administration wants all Indian Health Service funding to be mandatory, with automatic spending increases to address increasing costs, existing backlogs and key operational needs. 
In its congressional budget justification, the Indian Health Service says mandatory funding is necessary to get the full amount of funding it needs, as otherwise it’s limited by discretionary budget caps. The debt ceiling deal signed by Biden last week keeps nondefense discretionary spending flat next year and only allows for a 1 percent increase in fiscal 2025.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this change is part of the Biden administration’s goal to lift up groups that have been historically underserved.


  

“There are communities, whether it’s Indian Country, Native Americans, whether it’s rural America, whether it’s urban America, where people have felt left behind,” she said in April. “This is a story that is part of (Biden’s) economic policy, which is not leaving anybody behind, making sure that people get the assistance, they get the help that they sorely need.”
Native American advocates have been pushing for mandatory Indian Health Service funding for years. One such group, the National Council of Urban Indian Health, advocates for the health care needs of Native Americans living in urban areas. The council’s vice president of policy and communications, Meredith Raimondi, said unpredictable funding creates barriers to providing health care.
“If you’re a health care clinic and you’re trying to hire staff, and you don’t know what your funding is going to be next year, it’s a lot harder to plan and retain staff. It’s harder to buy lab equipment. It’s harder to know if you can pay (for) your lab testing and your vendors,” Raimondi said. “So it makes it extremely hard to deliver health care at a time when our health care needs are at an all time high.”


  

Making Indian Health Service funding mandatory would require an amendment to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which authorizes funding for the agency. 
Congress appears divided on the issue. 
In an interview, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who chairs the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, said he supports making Indian Health Service funding mandatory. But Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.), chair of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs, criticized the idea at a May hearing, suggesting the agency’s problems are actually the result of poor management.


  

“We need to see significant progress before how IHS is funded can significantly change,” Hageman said.
She said it’s important to focus on cutting the federal deficit.
“I just did a poll this week as to some of the issues that are the most important to my constituents in the state of Wyoming, and the budget and government and federal spending is at the top of the list,” Hageman said.
However, Ranking Member Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) pointed out that Biden’s proposed budget would actually reduce the deficit. Biden has proposed cutting the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the next 10 years, largely by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
“There are ways to reduce the deficit while also investing in what is important,” Leger Fernández said.
Raimondi said Native health care shouldn’t be cut to lower the deficit.
“Native Americans who gave up their land and who entered into treaties and have a trust relationship with the federal government are owed health care, regardless of whether or not the federal government needs to fix its deficit or cut costs,” Raimondi said.
Biden also requested full mandatory funding for the Indian Health Service last year, the first time that a president did so, according to that year’s Indian Health Service congressional budget justification. While this ultimately did not come to fruition, the last budget did make a significant change by providing advance appropriations for the agency, meaning some funding for fiscal 2024 was provided a year in advance. Prior to this change, the Indian Health Service was the only major federal health care provider to be funded solely by regular yearly appropriations.

This change means the agency will have more protection from government shutdowns. The 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 35 days, caused major disruptions to the agency’s services. At least five Indian Health Service patients died during the shutdown, according to the National Council of Urban Indian Health.
Raimondi said advance appropriations are an important step, but they still have to be passed by Congress each year. She said mandatory funding is needed to ensure proper health care for Native Americans.
“You need to have the mandatory funding so it’s not subject to the whim of political fights,” Raimondi said. “And so that we know that American Indian and Alaska Native people will have access to the health care that they deserve and earned.”

on the standing rock indian reservation which straddles the border between north and south dakota people line up at 6 am in the freezing winter hoping to get one of just four dental appointments
“if you don’t get those four you’re out you don’t get it” said janet alkire chairwoman of the standing rock sioux tribe who described the scene at an april hearing of the house natural resources subcommittee on indian and insular affairs 


  

and the lack of adequate medical care extends well beyond dental care she told lawmakers 
“our babies cannot be born on our reservation” she said “mothers have to leave their support networks their families sometimes the dads definitely the grandmothers behind and travel over 75 miles to deliver a baby”
through the indian health service the federal government provides free medical care for native americans which the united states promised in various treaties with indigenous nations when it forced them from their lands in the mid19th century 
however many native americans complain that the us government breaks this promise by underfunding the indian health service
in order to solve this problem the biden administration wants to take indian health service funding out of the annual budget negotiation process and instead have it baked into law its plan would culminate in around 44 billion in funding in fiscal 2033six times greater than current funding levels but still short of what experts and advocates say is needed
indian health service funding has increased 68 percent in the past decade culminating in 71 billion for the agency for fiscal 2023 but the agency’s funding is significantly less than other federal health care programs in 2017 indian health service spending per capita was less than half of that of the veterans health administration and less than a third compared to medicare according to a report by the government accountability office 


  

the national tribal budget formulation workgroup a group of native american advocates and tribal representatives that advises the indian health service on its annual budget request estimates that nearly seven times more funding for the agency is needed to meet native health care needs
in her testimony alkire described the impact of this lack of adequate funding
“the ihs hospital at standing rock is more than 60 years old” she said “it is falling apart and lacks space for lifesaving equipment”


  

“we recently purchased a ct scan machine with our own limited funds” alkire added “there was no room and we had to build it in the back entry to the building but we do what we have to do right”
such problems are not limited to that specific hospital according to the workgroup’s report on its fiscal 2024 budget recommendations indian health service hospitals have only 52 percent of the space needed based on the size of the population the agency cares for hospitals in indian country are also nearly four times older than the national average the report says
in its fiscal 2024 budget proposal released in march the biden administration called for full mandatory funding for the indian health service by fiscal 2025 the agency currently receives most of its funding through discretionary spending which must be debated by congress each year through the appropriations process programs like medicare and medicaid receive mandatory funding meaning they’re automatically given a certain amount each year as determined by law 


  

the white house is asking for 97 billion in total indian health service funding for fiscal 2024 including 16 billion in proposed mandatory funding for certain expenses by fiscal 2025 the administration wants all indian health service funding to be mandatory with automatic spending increases to address increasing costs existing backlogs and key operational needs 
in its congressional budget justification the indian health service says mandatory funding is necessary to get the full amount of funding it needs as otherwise it’s limited by discretionary budget caps the debt ceiling deal signed by biden last week keeps nondefense discretionary spending flat next year and only allows for a 1 percent increase in fiscal 2025
white house press secretary karine jeanpierre said this change is part of the biden administration’s goal to lift up groups that have been historically underserved


  

“there are communities whether it’s indian country native americans whether it’s rural america whether it’s urban america where people have felt left behind” she said in april “this is a story that is part of biden’s economic policy which is not leaving anybody behind making sure that people get the assistance they get the help that they sorely need”
native american advocates have been pushing for mandatory indian health service funding for years one such group the national council of urban indian health advocates for the health care needs of native americans living in urban areas the council’s vice president of policy and communications meredith raimondi said unpredictable funding creates barriers to providing health care
“if you’re a health care clinic and you’re trying to hire staff and you don’t know what your funding is going to be next year it’s a lot harder to plan and retain staff it’s harder to buy lab equipment it’s harder to know if you can pay for your lab testing and your vendors” raimondi said “so it makes it extremely hard to deliver health care at a time when our health care needs are at an all time high”


  

making indian health service funding mandatory would require an amendment to the indian health care improvement act which authorizes funding for the agency 
congress appears divided on the issue 
in an interview sen brian schatz dhawaii who chairs the senate committee on indian affairs said he supports making indian health service funding mandatory but rep harriet hageman rwyo chair of the house natural resources subcommittee on indian and insular affairs criticized the idea at a may hearing suggesting the agency’s problems are actually the result of poor management


  

“we need to see significant progress before how ihs is funded can significantly change” hageman said
she said it’s important to focus on cutting the federal deficit
“i just did a poll this week as to some of the issues that are the most important to my constituents in the state of wyoming and the budget and government and federal spending is at the top of the list” hageman said
however ranking member rep teresa leger fernández dnm pointed out that biden’s proposed budget would actually reduce the deficit biden has proposed cutting the deficit by nearly 3 trillion over the next 10 years largely by raising taxes on the wealthiest americans
“there are ways to reduce the deficit while also investing in what is important” leger fernández said
raimondi said native health care shouldn’t be cut to lower the deficit
“native americans who gave up their land and who entered into treaties and have a trust relationship with the federal government are owed health care regardless of whether or not the federal government needs to fix its deficit or cut costs” raimondi said
biden also requested full mandatory funding for the indian health service last year the first time that a president did so according to that year’s indian health service congressional budget justification while this ultimately did not come to fruition the last budget did make a significant change by providing advance appropriations for the agency meaning some funding for fiscal 2024 was provided a year in advance prior to this change the indian health service was the only major federal health care provider to be funded solely by regular yearly appropriations

this change means the agency will have more protection from government shutdowns the 20182019 shutdown which lasted 35 days caused major disruptions to the agency’s services at least five indian health service patients died during the shutdown according to the national council of urban indian health
raimondi said advance appropriations are an important step but they still have to be passed by congress each year she said mandatory funding is needed to ensure proper health care for native americans
“you need to have the mandatory funding so it’s not subject to the whim of political fights” raimondi said “and so that we know that american indian and alaska native people will have access to the health care that they deserve and earned”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) will sit with Fox News host Sean Hannity for an interview that will air next week, the network said Thursday. 
The interview, which will mark the Democrat’s first on the conservative cable news channel in more than a decade, will take place at the governor’s mansion in Sacramento on June 12, and “encompass topics such as immigration, current issues in California, the economy, the 2024 presidential election,” Fox News said. 


  

It will air during Hannity’s 9 p.m. nightly program. 
Like many elected Democrats, Newsom has railed against Fox News for years, in one recent interview calling the channel’s popular prime-time lineup of opinion shows “a disgrace.” 
“It’s a disgrace what they say, what these people say every single night,” Newsom said in January, speaking specifically about top hosts’ posture on guns and mass shootings.

“There’s xenophobia, they’re racial priming, what they have done to perpetuate crime and violence in this country, by scapegoating, and by doing not a damn thing about gun safety, not a damn thing for decades.”
Newsom previously warned that Democrats are getting “crushed” by the messaging being put forth on the channel, saying the network’s “ruthless” hosts “dominate the most important thing in American politics today, and that’s the narrative.” 
Newsom, a leading Democrat who has been sharply critical of former President Trump, has said he does not have plans to run for president in 2024, despite some speculation he may seek higher office.

53,53,The Hill,the hill,Charges could come from Florida grand jury: 'Venue matters'...,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4040729-venue-matters-trump-charges-could-come-from-florida-federal-grand-jury/,2023-06-08T19:00:05Z,‘Venue matters’: Trump charges could come from Florida federal grand juryThe late-stage presentation of evidence to a Florida grand jury is the latest sign that former President Trump may face trial … [+7945 chars],"

The late-stage presentation of evidence to a Florida grand jury is the latest sign that former President Trump may face trial in Miami as prosecutors work to insulate the Mar-a-Lago case from legal challenges stemming from the location of the proceedings.
Special counsel Jack Smith has for months been calling witnesses before a Washington, D.C., grand jury on the matter, but a recent flurry of activity in the case — just days after Trump’s attorneys met with Justice Department prosecutors in D.C. — has instead been in Florida.


  

This week, a handful of witnesses have been appearing in Florida, including Trump aide Taylor Budowich, who tweeted Wednesday that he was compelled to answer questions in the probe.
The move is a sign Smith is weighing filing charges there in addition to or instead of D.C., as defendants have a right to face trial where the alleged crime took place.

Determining the venue isn’t a low-stakes decision. A defendant can move to dismiss charges they believe haven’t been brought in the correct location.
“It signals that charges are likely to be in Florida, which also signals that I think the special counsel likely did not believe that he had venue for one or more of the charges in D.C.,” Brandon Van Grack, a former top national security lawyer with the Department of Justice (DOJ) who is now in private practice, told The Hill. 
But bringing the charges in Florida raises other considerations.


  

“For viewers who might be thinking, ‘Who cares as long as there are charges? Whether it’s D.C. or Florida, why does the venue matter?’ It really could make a huge difference. The jury pool is different. The judges are different,” Andrew Weissmann, who was one of the lead prosecutors on the Mueller investigation, said during an appearance on MSNBC.
“Also, D.C. is a location where the court is very used to dealing with classified information. There’s an expertise there. So in terms of speed, getting this case to trial, the venue matters.”

Trump’s legal team has been informed he is a target in the Mar-a-Lago probe, a move that usually precedes the filing of charges. 


  

Trump could face a multitude of charges in connection with the mishandling of records at Mar-a-Lago, including Espionage Act charges for willful retention of documents, as well as obstruction of justice charges stemming from the effort to keep them.
But while the effort to recover the documents stemmed from Washington — first from the National Archives and then from the DOJ — the timeline of the movement of the documents is at play in the case.
Trump’s legal team argued in a Supreme Court brief that he was still president while the boxes containing the classified documents were moved to Florida. 


  

If true, his team may be able to successfully argue to a judge that the conduct in question was initiated in the Sunshine State. 
Though the DOJ could try to make the case that Trump had involvement in the packing of the boxes during the D.C.-based transition, Van Grack notes that several circuits have determined that preparatory acts alone cannot be used to determine venue.
For obstruction of justice charges too, much of the activity appears to have occurred in Florida.


  

Prosecutors have zeroed in on a number of actions at Mar-a-Lago, from the failure to turn over all classified records following a subpoena last summer to video camera footage showing the movement of boxes in and out of a storage room.
A D.C. judge compelled testimony from Trump attorney Evan Corcoran after determining he may have been misled about how many documents remained at Mar-a-Lago. Corcoran returned 38 in response to the June 2022 subpoena, while the FBI found over 100 more when they searched the residence in August.

Judges can pierce attorney-client privilege if they believe legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime, and Corcoran has since recused himself from the case. 
Most recently, CNN reported that prosecutors have also been asking questions about the flooding of a room that housed servers of security footage after a Mar-a-Lago employee drained a pool. 
Obstruction charges in this case require proving a defendant knowingly concealed records and that they knowingly sought to impede an investigation. 


  

While subpoenas for the documents and video footage may have been issued in Washington, the D.C. circuit has held that the venue must be tied to where the unlawful conduct was committed.
On that front, prosecutors could be eyeing charges for more than just Trump.

DOJ officials have also been examining Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet who was spotted on security camera footage moving some of the boxes.
Timothy Parlatore, who until last month served as one of Trump’s attorneys in the matter and who has maintained the former president should not face charges in the probe, said there would be no basis for charging Nauta in D.C., and the same holds true for Trump.
“Ultimately, I haven’t seen anything in this case that would indicate that D.C. has jurisdiction. It’s something that when [top DOJ prosecutor] Jay Bratt opened the investigation, he started with a D.C. grand jury. I don’t think they had any basis to believe that there was jurisdiction in D.C. but that’s what he did. And that’s what Smith inherited,” Parlatore said.
“If they’re actually now getting down to where the rubber meets the road, they have to really consider, can they make out venue.”

It’s not entirely an either/or decision for Smith.
Prosecutors could bring different charges in different jurisdictions, trying Trump in two different cases.
Some see a benefit to bringing certain charges in D.C., where judges more routinely deal with classified information and some consider the jury pool to be more favorable to the DOJ.
On the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, prosecutors also noted they were investigating charges for concealment or removal of government records, a crime that requires showing a willful effort to keep the government from accessing its documents.

The charge could be one of the safest bets for bringing in D.C. 
“The existence of a separate grand jury in Florida considering evidence in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case strongly suggests that there may be *two* indictments due to venue issues, as there was in the [Paul] Manafort case,” Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, wrote on Twitter, referencing Trump’s former campaign manager.
“Certain potential crimes occurred *only* in Florida.”
But Van Grack said he doesn’t think that’s likely, given the DOJ’s own timeline considerations.
“It’s not that you can’t bring charges into different districts. But let’s also keep in mind, the special counsel, the Department of Justice has to try this case as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on the election. So the notion of bringing two different cases in two districts, I think would seem unlikely,” he said.
“You can do it. It delays things. It takes additional time. And I think it would be unlikely considering the time pressure that the Department of Justice is under to pursue that course.”
Weissmann wrote Thursday that the safest bet is to bring the case in Florida. 
“All else being equal, the prudent prosecutor will be reluctant to choose a venue where, if the government gets the venue decision wrong, it cannot proceed to try the defendant in another district for her crimes,” he wrote.
“Thus, although Florida may be a less advantageous district for the government — given its jury pool and its judges, who are less steeped in handling classified document cases … Florida is legally a less risky venue at this juncture.”

The late-stage presentation of evidence to a Florida grand jury is the latest sign that former President Trump may face trial in Miami as prosecutors work to insulate the Mar-a-Lago case from legal challenges stemming from the location of the proceedings.
Special counsel Jack Smith has for months been calling witnesses before a Washington, D.C., grand jury on the matter, but a recent flurry of activity in the case — just days after Trump’s attorneys met with Justice Department prosecutors in D.C. — has instead been in Florida.


  

This week, a handful of witnesses have been appearing in Florida, including Trump aide Taylor Budowich, who tweeted Wednesday that he was compelled to answer questions in the probe.
The move is a sign Smith is weighing filing charges there in addition to or instead of D.C., as defendants have a right to face trial where the alleged crime took place.

Determining the venue isn’t a low-stakes decision. A defendant can move to dismiss charges they believe haven’t been brought in the correct location.
“It signals that charges are likely to be in Florida, which also signals that I think the special counsel likely did not believe that he had venue for one or more of the charges in D.C.,” Brandon Van Grack, a former top national security lawyer with the Department of Justice (DOJ) who is now in private practice, told The Hill. 
But bringing the charges in Florida raises other considerations.


  

“For viewers who might be thinking, ‘Who cares as long as there are charges? Whether it’s D.C. or Florida, why does the venue matter?’ It really could make a huge difference. The jury pool is different. The judges are different,” Andrew Weissmann, who was one of the lead prosecutors on the Mueller investigation, said during an appearance on MSNBC.
“Also, D.C. is a location where the court is very used to dealing with classified information. There’s an expertise there. So in terms of speed, getting this case to trial, the venue matters.”

Trump’s legal team has been informed he is a target in the Mar-a-Lago probe, a move that usually precedes the filing of charges. 


  

Trump could face a multitude of charges in connection with the mishandling of records at Mar-a-Lago, including Espionage Act charges for willful retention of documents, as well as obstruction of justice charges stemming from the effort to keep them.
But while the effort to recover the documents stemmed from Washington — first from the National Archives and then from the DOJ — the timeline of the movement of the documents is at play in the case.
Trump’s legal team argued in a Supreme Court brief that he was still president while the boxes containing the classified documents were moved to Florida. 


  

If true, his team may be able to successfully argue to a judge that the conduct in question was initiated in the Sunshine State. 
Though the DOJ could try to make the case that Trump had involvement in the packing of the boxes during the D.C.-based transition, Van Grack notes that several circuits have determined that preparatory acts alone cannot be used to determine venue.
For obstruction of justice charges too, much of the activity appears to have occurred in Florida.


  

Prosecutors have zeroed in on a number of actions at Mar-a-Lago, from the failure to turn over all classified records following a subpoena last summer to video camera footage showing the movement of boxes in and out of a storage room.
A D.C. judge compelled testimony from Trump attorney Evan Corcoran after determining he may have been misled about how many documents remained at Mar-a-Lago. Corcoran returned 38 in response to the June 2022 subpoena, while the FBI found over 100 more when they searched the residence in August.

Judges can pierce attorney-client privilege if they believe legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime, and Corcoran has since recused himself from the case. 
Most recently, CNN reported that prosecutors have also been asking questions about the flooding of a room that housed servers of security footage after a Mar-a-Lago employee drained a pool. 
Obstruction charges in this case require proving a defendant knowingly concealed records and that they knowingly sought to impede an investigation. 


  

While subpoenas for the documents and video footage may have been issued in Washington, the D.C. circuit has held that the venue must be tied to where the unlawful conduct was committed.
On that front, prosecutors could be eyeing charges for more than just Trump.

DOJ officials have also been examining Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet who was spotted on security camera footage moving some of the boxes.
Timothy Parlatore, who until last month served as one of Trump’s attorneys in the matter and who has maintained the former president should not face charges in the probe, said there would be no basis for charging Nauta in D.C., and the same holds true for Trump.
“Ultimately, I haven’t seen anything in this case that would indicate that D.C. has jurisdiction. It’s something that when [top DOJ prosecutor] Jay Bratt opened the investigation, he started with a D.C. grand jury. I don’t think they had any basis to believe that there was jurisdiction in D.C. but that’s what he did. And that’s what Smith inherited,” Parlatore said.
“If they’re actually now getting down to where the rubber meets the road, they have to really consider, can they make out venue.”

It’s not entirely an either/or decision for Smith.
Prosecutors could bring different charges in different jurisdictions, trying Trump in two different cases.
Some see a benefit to bringing certain charges in D.C., where judges more routinely deal with classified information and some consider the jury pool to be more favorable to the DOJ.
On the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, prosecutors also noted they were investigating charges for concealment or removal of government records, a crime that requires showing a willful effort to keep the government from accessing its documents.

The charge could be one of the safest bets for bringing in D.C. 
“The existence of a separate grand jury in Florida considering evidence in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case strongly suggests that there may be *two* indictments due to venue issues, as there was in the [Paul] Manafort case,” Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, wrote on Twitter, referencing Trump’s former campaign manager.
“Certain potential crimes occurred *only* in Florida.”
But Van Grack said he doesn’t think that’s likely, given the DOJ’s own timeline considerations.
“It’s not that you can’t bring charges into different districts. But let’s also keep in mind, the special counsel, the Department of Justice has to try this case as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on the election. So the notion of bringing two different cases in two districts, I think would seem unlikely,” he said.
“You can do it. It delays things. It takes additional time. And I think it would be unlikely considering the time pressure that the Department of Justice is under to pursue that course.”
Weissmann wrote Thursday that the safest bet is to bring the case in Florida. 
“All else being equal, the prudent prosecutor will be reluctant to choose a venue where, if the government gets the venue decision wrong, it cannot proceed to try the defendant in another district for her crimes,” he wrote.
“Thus, although Florida may be a less advantageous district for the government — given its jury pool and its judges, who are less steeped in handling classified document cases … Florida is legally a less risky venue at this juncture.”

55,55,The Hill,the hill,Charges could come from Florida grand jury: 'Venue matters'...,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4040729-venue-matters-trump-charges-could-come-from-florida-federal-grand-jury/,2023-06-08T19:00:05Z,‘Venue matters’: Trump charges could come from Florida federal grand juryThe late-stage presentation of evidence to a Florida grand jury is the latest sign that former President Trump may face trial … [+7945 chars],"

The late-stage presentation of evidence to a Florida grand jury is the latest sign that former President Trump may face trial in Miami as prosecutors work to insulate the Mar-a-Lago case from legal challenges stemming from the location of the proceedings.
Special counsel Jack Smith has for months been calling witnesses before a Washington, D.C., grand jury on the matter, but a recent flurry of activity in the case — just days after Trump’s attorneys met with Justice Department prosecutors in D.C. — has instead been in Florida.


  

This week, a handful of witnesses have been appearing in Florida, including Trump aide Taylor Budowich, who tweeted Wednesday that he was compelled to answer questions in the probe.
The move is a sign Smith is weighing filing charges there in addition to or instead of D.C., as defendants have a right to face trial where the alleged crime took place.

Determining the venue isn’t a low-stakes decision. A defendant can move to dismiss charges they believe haven’t been brought in the correct location.
“It signals that charges are likely to be in Florida, which also signals that I think the special counsel likely did not believe that he had venue for one or more of the charges in D.C.,” Brandon Van Grack, a former top national security lawyer with the Department of Justice (DOJ) who is now in private practice, told The Hill. 
But bringing the charges in Florida raises other considerations.


  

“For viewers who might be thinking, ‘Who cares as long as there are charges? Whether it’s D.C. or Florida, why does the venue matter?’ It really could make a huge difference. The jury pool is different. The judges are different,” Andrew Weissmann, who was one of the lead prosecutors on the Mueller investigation, said during an appearance on MSNBC.
“Also, D.C. is a location where the court is very used to dealing with classified information. There’s an expertise there. So in terms of speed, getting this case to trial, the venue matters.”

Trump’s legal team has been informed he is a target in the Mar-a-Lago probe, a move that usually precedes the filing of charges. 


  

Trump could face a multitude of charges in connection with the mishandling of records at Mar-a-Lago, including Espionage Act charges for willful retention of documents, as well as obstruction of justice charges stemming from the effort to keep them.
But while the effort to recover the documents stemmed from Washington — first from the National Archives and then from the DOJ — the timeline of the movement of the documents is at play in the case.
Trump’s legal team argued in a Supreme Court brief that he was still president while the boxes containing the classified documents were moved to Florida. 


  

If true, his team may be able to successfully argue to a judge that the conduct in question was initiated in the Sunshine State. 
Though the DOJ could try to make the case that Trump had involvement in the packing of the boxes during the D.C.-based transition, Van Grack notes that several circuits have determined that preparatory acts alone cannot be used to determine venue.
For obstruction of justice charges too, much of the activity appears to have occurred in Florida.


  

Prosecutors have zeroed in on a number of actions at Mar-a-Lago, from the failure to turn over all classified records following a subpoena last summer to video camera footage showing the movement of boxes in and out of a storage room.
A D.C. judge compelled testimony from Trump attorney Evan Corcoran after determining he may have been misled about how many documents remained at Mar-a-Lago. Corcoran returned 38 in response to the June 2022 subpoena, while the FBI found over 100 more when they searched the residence in August.

Judges can pierce attorney-client privilege if they believe legal advice was given in furtherance of a crime, and Corcoran has since recused himself from the case. 
Most recently, CNN reported that prosecutors have also been asking questions about the flooding of a room that housed servers of security footage after a Mar-a-Lago employee drained a pool. 
Obstruction charges in this case require proving a defendant knowingly concealed records and that they knowingly sought to impede an investigation. 


  

While subpoenas for the documents and video footage may have been issued in Washington, the D.C. circuit has held that the venue must be tied to where the unlawful conduct was committed.
On that front, prosecutors could be eyeing charges for more than just Trump.

DOJ officials have also been examining Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet who was spotted on security camera footage moving some of the boxes.
Timothy Parlatore, who until last month served as one of Trump’s attorneys in the matter and who has maintained the former president should not face charges in the probe, said there would be no basis for charging Nauta in D.C., and the same holds true for Trump.
“Ultimately, I haven’t seen anything in this case that would indicate that D.C. has jurisdiction. It’s something that when [top DOJ prosecutor] Jay Bratt opened the investigation, he started with a D.C. grand jury. I don’t think they had any basis to believe that there was jurisdiction in D.C. but that’s what he did. And that’s what Smith inherited,” Parlatore said.
“If they’re actually now getting down to where the rubber meets the road, they have to really consider, can they make out venue.”

It’s not entirely an either/or decision for Smith.
Prosecutors could bring different charges in different jurisdictions, trying Trump in two different cases.
Some see a benefit to bringing certain charges in D.C., where judges more routinely deal with classified information and some consider the jury pool to be more favorable to the DOJ.
On the warrant to search Mar-a-Lago, prosecutors also noted they were investigating charges for concealment or removal of government records, a crime that requires showing a willful effort to keep the government from accessing its documents.

The charge could be one of the safest bets for bringing in D.C. 
“The existence of a separate grand jury in Florida considering evidence in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case strongly suggests that there may be *two* indictments due to venue issues, as there was in the [Paul] Manafort case,” Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, wrote on Twitter, referencing Trump’s former campaign manager.
“Certain potential crimes occurred *only* in Florida.”
But Van Grack said he doesn’t think that’s likely, given the DOJ’s own timeline considerations.
“It’s not that you can’t bring charges into different districts. But let’s also keep in mind, the special counsel, the Department of Justice has to try this case as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on the election. So the notion of bringing two different cases in two districts, I think would seem unlikely,” he said.
“You can do it. It delays things. It takes additional time. And I think it would be unlikely considering the time pressure that the Department of Justice is under to pursue that course.”
Weissmann wrote Thursday that the safest bet is to bring the case in Florida. 
“All else being equal, the prudent prosecutor will be reluctant to choose a venue where, if the government gets the venue decision wrong, it cannot proceed to try the defendant in another district for her crimes,” he wrote.
“Thus, although Florida may be a less advantageous district for the government — given its jury pool and its judges, who are less steeped in handling classified document cases … Florida is legally a less risky venue at this juncture.”

The Mexican government late Thursday condemned Florida’s migrant relocation program, adding to the jurisdictions potentially threatening legal action against the Sunshine State’s GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis.
“The Government of Mexico emphatically condemns the practice of transporting migrant persons from states bordering Mexico toward other parts of the United States with electoral and political ends,” reads a statement from the Mexican foreign ministry.


  

The statement specified its censure was targeted at migrant relocations to Massachusetts — Florida kicked off its relocation program transporting 49 Venezuelans from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard — New York, and Sacramento, Calif.
Mexico had mostly remained quiet about the practice that has set off a feud between DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), but the Mexican Consulate General in Sacramento revealed that one of the migrants shuttled to Sacramento on a Florida-sponsored migrant flight is a Mexican citizen from the southern state of Chiapas.
“From the U.S. Border, you can see individuals on Mexican soil engaged in drug and human trafficking,” said Jeremy Redfern, the press secretary for DeSantis’s executive office.
“It would be great if the Mexican Government could focus on these problems rather than wasting its breath on some unfounded legal claim relating to illegal immigrants that voluntarily get a free ride to a sanctuary jurisdiction that purports to welcome them with open arms.“
A majority of migrants embroiled in the relocation program are Venezuelan nationals, many of whom are legally in the United States as asylum applicants.
Mexican nationals generally face a higher bar to claim asylum in the United States, because the country’s relative stability makes it harder to prove individualized persecution.


  

“The Secretariat of Foreign relations reiterates its commitment to guarantee the defense of Mexican persons who live abroad, independently of their migratory status,” reads a statement by the foreign ministry.
“Legal and diplomatic measures will be explored given this worrying practice.”
The legal threat adds Mexico to the growing number of jurisdictions pushing back on the practice through legal means, rather than just condemning its morality.


  

California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced earlier this week an investigation into the practice, and Bexar County (Texas) Sheriff Javier Salazar filed felony and misdemeanor unlawful restraint charges over the flights to Martha’s Vineyard.
Those two investigations center on whether the migrants were deceived to board the planes; many migrants have said they were promised jobs if they boarded the planes, and the Bexar County investigation also delved into allegations that migrants were told boarding would help their migratory status.
The investigations and ensuing Newsom-DeSantis feud followed more tepid reactions from East Coast and Midwest Democrats such as New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who criticized the practice but laid blame on the Biden administration for what he’s referred to as a “burden.”


  

Newsom, a Democrat rumored to have future presidential aspirations, has taken to Twitter and the airwaves to attack DeSantis, who trails only former President Trump in the 2024 GOP presidential race.
Newsom called DeSantis a “small, pathetic man” and threatened kidnapping charges as Bonta announced his investigation.

DeSantis, who had touted his migrant relocation program before the Texas and California investigations, has taken a more muted tone since.


  

At a roundtable in Arizona on Wednesday, DeSantis did not directly address the flights to Sacramento or Newsom’s barbs, but instead stuck to the GOP playbook of criticizing the Biden administration’s immigration policies.

the mexican government late thursday condemned florida’s migrant relocation program adding to the jurisdictions potentially threatening legal action against the sunshine state’s gop gov ron desantis
“the government of mexico emphatically condemns the practice of transporting migrant persons from states bordering mexico toward other parts of the united states with electoral and political ends” reads a statement from the mexican foreign ministry


  

the statement specified its censure was targeted at migrant relocations to massachusettsflorida kicked off its relocation program transporting 49 venezuelans from texas to martha’s vineyardnew york and sacramento calif
mexico had mostly remained quiet about the practice that has set off a feud between desantis and california gov gavin newsom d but the mexican consulate general in sacramento revealed that one of the migrants shuttled to sacramento on a floridasponsored migrant flight is a mexican citizen from the southern state of chiapas
“from the us border you can see individuals on mexican soil engaged in drug and human trafficking” said jeremy redfern the press secretary for desantis’s executive office
“it would be great if the mexican government could focus on these problems rather than wasting its breath on some unfounded legal claim relating to illegal immigrants that voluntarily get a free ride to a sanctuary jurisdiction that purports to welcome them with open arms“
a majority of migrants embroiled in the relocation program are venezuelan nationals many of whom are legally in the united states as asylum applicants
mexican nationals generally face a higher bar to claim asylum in the united states because the country’s relative stability makes it harder to prove individualized persecution


  

“the secretariat of foreign relations reiterates its commitment to guarantee the defense of mexican persons who live abroad independently of their migratory status” reads a statement by the foreign ministry
“legal and diplomatic measures will be explored given this worrying practice”
the legal threat adds mexico to the growing number of jurisdictions pushing back on the practice through legal means rather than just condemning its morality


  

california attorney general rob bonta announced earlier this week an investigation into the practice and bexar county texas sheriff javier salazar filed felony and misdemeanor unlawful restraint charges over the flights to martha’s vineyard

The hosts on MSNBC had a laugh on Friday during a “dramatic reading” that host Rachel Maddow gave of former President Trump’s indictment over the classified and sensitive documents kept at Mar-a-Lago after his presidency. 
Maddow recited a transcript of an interview that Trump allegedly gave to a writer and a publisher for an at-the-time upcoming book in July 2021 that was included in the charging document. During the conversation, which also included a member of his staff, Trump seems to discuss a document he had that he told the others about that he could have declassified as president but now cannot. 


  

“Trump: See as president I could have declassified it. Staffer: Yeah. Ha ha. Trump: Now I can’t, you know but it is still a secret. Staffer: Yeah. Ha ha. Now we have a problem. Trump: Isn’t that interesting?” Maddow recited as she and others began laughing. 
The conversation seems to undermine Trump’s argument that he declassified all the documents that were taken from the White House after he left office. He has been charged with 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act, conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements and representations and violating a few other laws. 
Despite Trump’s defense that he declassified the documents and the conversation he allegedly had, classification status is not a determinant as to whether the Espionage Act was violated. The law only considers if the information put at risk could have harmed U.S. national security or helped a foreign country.

“Yes, you do have a problem because you just acknowledged this is a classified document that you have shown to a staffer with no security clearance as well as a reporter in the room,” Maddow said. 
The hosts also chuckled at comments Trump made in 2017 that were mentioned in the indictment. The document included remarks Trump said during a press conference in which he condemned those who leak classified information to members of the press, saying they should be “ashamed of themselves.” 
Maddow said special counsel Jack Smith, who has been conducting the investigation into this matter, included the comments to show Trump is aware that sharing classified information with those not allowed to have it is illegal.

The editorial board said in a … [+3143 chars]","

The editorial board for The National Review said one cannot read the allegations outlined in the federal indictment against former President Trump and “not be appalled.” 
The editorial board said in a post on Saturday that it has in the past pointed out times that it believes Trump’s opponents have manipulated the law to pursue politically motivated legal claims against him. It added that the members of the board do not like the precedent of a federal prosecutor who serves under the president indicting the president’s lead rival for reelection. 


  

“That said, it is impossible to read the indictment against Trump in the Mar-a-Lago documents case and not be appalled at the way he handled classified documents as an ex-president, and responded to the attempt by federal authorities to reclaim them,” the editorial states. 
The board for the conservative news outlet noted that many of the boxes that Trump had moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago at the end of his presidency only contained newspaper clippings, photos, cards and letters, but they also included hundreds of documents with classified markings. 
The information on the documents covered information relating to U.S. nuclear programs, defense capabilities, vulnerabilities and plans for potential retaliatory action in the event of an attack from another country, according to the indictment. 
The board said Trump no longer had a right to possess these documents after his term ended, and he stored them “recklessly” in locations like his bedroom, a bathroom and a ballroom at Mar-a-Lago. It also mentioned federal prosecutors’ allegations that Trump ignored requests for the documents to be returned for months and attempted to keep investigators from obtaining the documents he had. 
The editorial board argued the “most damning” part of the indictment is the transcript of the conversation Trump had in which he showed one document to a reporter who was not authorized to see it. 
“Equally damning, particularly for someone who was and would like again to be the nation’s chief executive, responsible for the enforcement of the laws, is the evidence that Trump not only deceived the investigators and the grand jury, but his own lawyers — knowing and intending that they would consequently obstruct the investigation,” the editorial states. 


  

The indictment alleges that Trump had an aide, who has also been indicted, move boxes of documents away from a storage room when one of his attorneys came to Mar-a-Lago to confirm that the subpoena was being fully complied with. This caused his legal team to wrongly tell investigators that all documents had been turned over.

		Biden selects Mandy Cohen as next CDC director	

The board said it understands conservatives might be frustrated with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not facing charges for her use of a private email server while serving and that President Biden might not face charges for his own alleged mishandling of some classified documents. 
“But it doesn’t change the fact the country wouldn’t be in this uncharted territory if Trump hadn’t taken documents he had no right to, and simply complied when asked to give them back,” the editorial concludes. 


  

The board previously declared in November that it would reject Trump as a choice for the Republican nomination for president in 2024.

maddow recited a transcript of an interview that trump allegedly gave to a writer and a publisher for an atthetime upcoming book in july 2021 that was included in the charging document during the conversation which also included a member of his staff trump seems to discuss a document he had that he told the others about that he could have declassified as president but now cannot 


  

“trump see as president i could have declassified it staffer yeah ha ha trump now i can’t you know but it is still a secret staffer yeah ha ha now we have a problem trump isn’t that interesting” maddow recited as she and others began laughing 
the conversation seems to undermine trump’s argument that he declassified all the documents that were taken from the white house after he left office he has been charged with 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information in violation of the espionage act conspiracy to obstruct justice making false statements and representations and violating a few other laws 
despite trump’s defense that he declassified the documents and the conversation he allegedly had classification status is not a determinant as to whether the espionage act was violated the law only considers if the information put at risk could have harmed us national security or helped a foreign country

“yes you do have a problem because you just acknowledged this is a classified document that you have shown to a staffer with no security clearance as well as a reporter in the room” maddow said 
the hosts also chuckled at comments trump made in 2017 that were mentioned in the indictment the document included remarks trump said during a press conference in which he condemned those who leak classified information to members of the press saying they should be “ashamed of themselves” 
maddow said special counsel jack smith who has been conducting the investigation into this matter included the comments to show trump is aware that sharing classified information with those not allowed to have it is illegal

Editor’s note: This report has been updated to clarify that the indictment accuses former President Trump of showing a classified document about attacking Iran to a writer without security clearance.
Senate Republican leaders, including Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), are staying quiet about former President Trump’s indictment on 37 criminal charges, letting him twist in the wind and breaking with House Republican leaders who have rushed to Trump’s defense.   


  

McConnell, who is careful not to comment on Trump or even repeat his name in public, has said to his GOP colleagues that he wants his party to turn the page on the former president, whom he sees as a flawed general election candidate and a drag on Senate Republican candidates.    
The Senate GOP leader’s top deputies — Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) — have also indicated they don’t want Trump to win the party’s 2024 presidential nomination.   
They, along with McConnell, are letting Trump’s legal troubles unfold without coming to the former president’s defense, in contrast to Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), who both issued statements Thursday criticizing the Justice Department before the indictment was unsealed to the public.   
“They want him to go away, so they wouldn’t be very upset if this is the thing that finally takes him out,” a former Senate Republican aide said about the Senate Republican leaders’ silence on Trump’s indictment.

Republican senators were more outspoken in defending Trump in April, after liberal Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unveiled an indictment charging him with 34 felony counts related to business records fraud.   
Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declined to express confidence in Bragg when asked about him in late March.  


  

Special prosecutor Jack Smith, whom Attorney General Merrick Garland tapped in November to investigate Trump, has more credibility among Republicans.   
“Jack Smith is very credible,” said the former Senate GOP aide.  
“There is the reflection that he may have actually found finally the silver bullet” to end Trump’s political career, the former aide said, noting that Smith has a tape of Trump acknowledging that he had retained classified documents after leaving office that he didn’t declassify while president.

A Senate Republican aide said the indictment is “pretty damning.”  
“The documents that he did have, and who he was showing them to and where he was storing them, is all pretty damning,” the aide said. “I don’t know if it will make a difference in the political landscape, but it certainly seems pretty bad.”  
The indictment accuses Trump of showing a classified document laying out the military strategy for an attack against Iran to a writer who didn’t have security clearance.   


  

The former president also showed a sensitive military map to a staffer for his political action committee.  
Photos included in the indictment showed that Trump haphazardly stashed boxes of sensitive materials around his residence at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, including in a ballroom, a bathroom, a shower, office space and his bedroom.  
One photo showed documents scattered across the floor of a storage room.   


  

Nevertheless, House Republican leaders are speaking out forcefully against the indictment.   
“This is going to disrupt the nation because it goes to the core of equal justice for all, which is not being seen today. And we’re not going to stand for it,” McCarthy told Fox News in an interview Friday.  
Scalise tweeted Thursday evening “this sham indictment is the continuation of the endless political persecution of Donald Trump.”  


  

Former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), a one-time advisor to McConnell’s leadership team and whose home state will host the second contest of next year’s Republican presidential primary, said the Department of Justice’s indictment may prove too much for Trump to overcome.  
“At some point there’s a straw that breaks the camel’s back, and there’s a whole lot of straws on the back of Donald Trump right now,” he said.  
Gregg called the legal problems facing Trump clearly “outside the norm for a major leader of our nation.”  


  

A New York jury last month found Trump liable for sexual abuse and awarded his accuser, the writer E. Jean Carroll, a $5 million judgment.   
“Most Republicans want somebody else, even Trump people want somebody else, because they want to win and they recognize Trump is incapable of winning a general election at this point,” Gregg said.   
He said Senate Republican leaders should call on the GOP to move past the former president.  
“I would be advising them to say, ‘Listen, we have to move on as a party. Let Donald Trump work through his legal issues, which are considerable, but we as a party need to move on, and let’s find ourselves a candidate for president who can win,’” he said.  
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Friday evening said the charges brought by the Department of Justice are “quite serious and cannot be casually dismissed.”
She said in a statement that “mishandling classified documents is a federal crime because it can expose national secrets, as well as the sources and methods they were obtained through.”
Murkowski, who voted to convict Trump on the impeachment charge of inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, joined fellow Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) in being the only two Republican senators to criticize Trump shortly after the indictment became public.
Romney, who voted twice to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2020 and 2021, defended the Justice Department from criticisms voiced by other Republicans that it is acting unfairly.
“By all appearances, the Justice Department and special counsel have exercised due care, affording Mr. Trump the time and opportunity to avoid charges that would not generally have been afforded to others,” Romney said in a statement.  
“Mr. Trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so,” he said.   
Senate conservatives have come to Trump’s defense, notably Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).   
“The Biden administration’s actions can only be compared to the type of oppressive tactics routinely seen in nations such as Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua, which are absolutely alien and unacceptable in America,” Lee said in a statement. “It is an affront to our country’s glorious 246-year legacy of independence from tyranny, for the incumbent president of the United States to leverage the machinery of justice against a political rival.”   
Cruz, speaking on his “The Verdict” podcast, called the indictment “an assault on democracy,” “garbage” and “a political attack from a thoroughly corrupted and weaponized Department of Justice.”  
Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking member of the Senate GOP leadership, who voted against the debt deal and is seen within the Senate GOP conference as someone who has tried to ally himself with its most conservative members, also criticized the indictment.   
“This indictment certainly looks like an unequal application of justice,” he said in a statement, pointing out that “large amounts of classified materials were found in President Biden’s garage in Delaware” yet “no indictment.”   
Yet many other Republican senators, particularly those more closely allied with McConnell, are staying conspicuously quiet about Trump’s legal travails.  
One GOP senator who requested anonymity defended the Justice Department, pushing back on accusations that because Garland is a Biden appointee, the prosecution is necessarily motivated by politics.

“Where do you draw the line?” the senator said. “Everybody owes their job to someone.  
“We have to trust our institutions, and there’s not a lot of trust right now,” the senator added.

House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) sparred with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday over former President Trump’s indictment in the Justice Department’s probe into his handling of classified documents.
Jordan firmly defended Trump during the segment, stressing that “the president’s ability to classify and control access to national security information flows from the Constitution” and that “he can put it wherever he wants, he can handle it however he wants.”


  

But Bash pushed back, noting a recording of Trump that revealed he acknowledged he couldn’t declassify documents once he was no longer in the White House.
“He says point blank on tape, ‘As president, I could have declassified it. Now I can’t.’ … It’s on tape as part of this indictment that he did not declassify the material,” Bash said of Trump, referring to a transcript of an audio recording obtained by CNN. 
“Saying he could have is not the same as saying he did it,” Jordan said.
“He said, ‘Now I can’t,'” Bash said. 
“Now he can’t — right, because he’s not president now. But when he was president he did declassify,” Jordan said.
“Which means that it’s classified. Which means that what he was holding was classified,” Bash said as the two talked over each other.


  

“Not if he declassified it when he was president of the United States, for goodness sake,” Jordan said. 
“But he’s saying point blank in this audio tape that he did not declassify it. What you’re saying just doesn’t make sense on its face,” Bash said.
Trump was indicted last week on 37 counts in connection to the mishandling of records as well as his efforts to prevent the government from recovering the documents after the end of his White House term, according to the unsealed indictment.

Bash repeatedly pressed Jordan over Trump appearing to admit he did not declassify documents, some of which had to do with the country’s military and foreign defense capabilities, U.S. nuclear programs and potential vulnerabilities of the U.S. and its allies. 
“Do you have evidence that the president — when he was president, now former president — actually declassified these documents before he took them?” Bash asked.
“I go on the president’s word and he said he did,” responded Jordan, who has consistently been one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress.

Former Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday that a possible conviction of former President Trump, if he’s elected to a second term as president in 2024, would lead to an impeachment proceeding and him being eventually removed from office. 
During an appearance on MSNBC’s “Inside with Jen Psaki,” host Jen Psaki mentioned to Holder that Trump is remaining committed to his 2024 presidential campaign, despite facing his second indictment in the past two months. 


  

“Well, the notion that you could have a trial, defend it, be convicted, somehow win the election, be sworn in as a president, or whenever it happens, that seems inconsistent with our notion of fairness, of the rule of law,” Holder said. “At that point, I would hope that an impeachment proceeding might be considered. Not only considered, brought. And, ultimately, he would be moved from office.” 
“The notion that a convicted felon, convicted felon, would serve as president of the United States is absurd. It’s simply absurd,” Holder added. 
When asked if there should be an impeachment hearing and proceedings in Congress if Trump is convicted, Holder agreed, saying in part that people have “underestimated the impact of this indictment,” also noting Trump’s indictment in a Manhattan court in April and the ongoing investigations he faces in Georgia and in Washington, D.C. 
“I’m not a political pundit, but I think at some point, you certainly won’t get beyond, you know, the Trump cult base, but for people who are on the fringes of that, the outside of that, are likely to have been negatively impacted by all of these cases brought against the former president,” Holder added. “I think that that will have some electoral effect. And so, the likelihood that he’ll be able to survive this and win a general election, I think, is pretty small.”

Speaking at the North Carolina GOP convention, Trump said that he’s standing firm on his 2024 presidential campaign. 
“I will never yield,” Trump said. “I will never be deterred.”


  

Trump, who announced his 2024 presidential campaign last November, was charged with 37 counts Friday for his alleged mishandling of classified material and efforts to prevent the federal government from retrieving them, according to the unsealed indictment.

Editor’s note: This report has been updated to clarify that the indictment accuses former President Trump of showing a classified document about attacking Iran to a writer without security clearance.
Senate Republican leaders, including Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), are staying quiet about former President Trump’s indictment on 37 criminal charges, letting him twist in the wind and breaking with House Republican leaders who have rushed to Trump’s defense.   


  

McConnell, who is careful not to comment on Trump or even repeat his name in public, has said to his GOP colleagues that he wants his party to turn the page on the former president, whom he sees as a flawed general election candidate and a drag on Senate Republican candidates.    
The Senate GOP leader’s top deputies — Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) — have also indicated they don’t want Trump to win the party’s 2024 presidential nomination.   
They, along with McConnell, are letting Trump’s legal troubles unfold without coming to the former president’s defense, in contrast to Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), who both issued statements Thursday criticizing the Justice Department before the indictment was unsealed to the public.   
“They want him to go away, so they wouldn’t be very upset if this is the thing that finally takes him out,” a former Senate Republican aide said about the Senate Republican leaders’ silence on Trump’s indictment.

Republican senators were more outspoken in defending Trump in April, after liberal Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg unveiled an indictment charging him with 34 felony counts related to business records fraud.   
Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declined to express confidence in Bragg when asked about him in late March.  


  

Special prosecutor Jack Smith, whom Attorney General Merrick Garland tapped in November to investigate Trump, has more credibility among Republicans.   
“Jack Smith is very credible,” said the former Senate GOP aide.  
“There is the reflection that he may have actually found finally the silver bullet” to end Trump’s political career, the former aide said, noting that Smith has a tape of Trump acknowledging that he had retained classified documents after leaving office that he didn’t declassify while president.

A Senate Republican aide said the indictment is “pretty damning.”  
“The documents that he did have, and who he was showing them to and where he was storing them, is all pretty damning,” the aide said. “I don’t know if it will make a difference in the political landscape, but it certainly seems pretty bad.”  
The indictment accuses Trump of showing a classified document laying out the military strategy for an attack against Iran to a writer who didn’t have security clearance.   


  

The former president also showed a sensitive military map to a staffer for his political action committee.  
Photos included in the indictment showed that Trump haphazardly stashed boxes of sensitive materials around his residence at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, including in a ballroom, a bathroom, a shower, office space and his bedroom.  
One photo showed documents scattered across the floor of a storage room.   


  

Nevertheless, House Republican leaders are speaking out forcefully against the indictment.   
“This is going to disrupt the nation because it goes to the core of equal justice for all, which is not being seen today. And we’re not going to stand for it,” McCarthy told Fox News in an interview Friday.  
Scalise tweeted Thursday evening “this sham indictment is the continuation of the endless political persecution of Donald Trump.”  


  

Former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), a one-time advisor to McConnell’s leadership team and whose home state will host the second contest of next year’s Republican presidential primary, said the Department of Justice’s indictment may prove too much for Trump to overcome.  
“At some point there’s a straw that breaks the camel’s back, and there’s a whole lot of straws on the back of Donald Trump right now,” he said.  
Gregg called the legal problems facing Trump clearly “outside the norm for a major leader of our nation.”  


  

A New York jury last month found Trump liable for sexual abuse and awarded his accuser, the writer E. Jean Carroll, a $5 million judgment.   
“Most Republicans want somebody else, even Trump people want somebody else, because they want to win and they recognize Trump is incapable of winning a general election at this point,” Gregg said.   
He said Senate Republican leaders should call on the GOP to move past the former president.  
“I would be advising them to say, ‘Listen, we have to move on as a party. Let Donald Trump work through his legal issues, which are considerable, but we as a party need to move on, and let’s find ourselves a candidate for president who can win,’” he said.  
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Friday evening said the charges brought by the Department of Justice are “quite serious and cannot be casually dismissed.”
She said in a statement that “mishandling classified documents is a federal crime because it can expose national secrets, as well as the sources and methods they were obtained through.”
Murkowski, who voted to convict Trump on the impeachment charge of inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, joined fellow Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) in being the only two Republican senators to criticize Trump shortly after the indictment became public.
Romney, who voted twice to convict Trump on impeachment charges in 2020 and 2021, defended the Justice Department from criticisms voiced by other Republicans that it is acting unfairly.
“By all appearances, the Justice Department and special counsel have exercised due care, affording Mr. Trump the time and opportunity to avoid charges that would not generally have been afforded to others,” Romney said in a statement.  
“Mr. Trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so,” he said.   
Senate conservatives have come to Trump’s defense, notably Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).   
“The Biden administration’s actions can only be compared to the type of oppressive tactics routinely seen in nations such as Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua, which are absolutely alien and unacceptable in America,” Lee said in a statement. “It is an affront to our country’s glorious 246-year legacy of independence from tyranny, for the incumbent president of the United States to leverage the machinery of justice against a political rival.”   
Cruz, speaking on his “The Verdict” podcast, called the indictment “an assault on democracy,” “garbage” and “a political attack from a thoroughly corrupted and weaponized Department of Justice.”  
Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the third-ranking member of the Senate GOP leadership, who voted against the debt deal and is seen within the Senate GOP conference as someone who has tried to ally himself with its most conservative members, also criticized the indictment.   
“This indictment certainly looks like an unequal application of justice,” he said in a statement, pointing out that “large amounts of classified materials were found in President Biden’s garage in Delaware” yet “no indictment.”   
Yet many other Republican senators, particularly those more closely allied with McConnell, are staying conspicuously quiet about Trump’s legal travails.  
One GOP senator who requested anonymity defended the Justice Department, pushing back on accusations that because Garland is a Biden appointee, the prosecution is necessarily motivated by politics.

“Where do you draw the line?” the senator said. “Everybody owes their job to someone.  
“We have to trust our institutions, and there’s not a lot of trust right now,” the senator added.

editor’s note this report has been updated to clarify that the indictment accuses former president trump of showing a classified document about attacking iran to a writer without security clearance
senate republican leaders including sen mitch mcconnell rky are staying quiet about former president trump’s indictment on 37 criminal charges letting him twist in the wind and breaking with house republican leaders who have rushed to trump’s defense   


  

mcconnell who is careful not to comment on trump or even repeat his name in public has said to his gop colleagues that he wants his party to turn the page on the former president whom he sees as a flawed general election candidate and a drag on senate republican candidates    
the senate gop leader’s top deputiessenate republican whip john thune sd and sen john cornyn rtexashave also indicated they don’t want trump to win the party’s 2024 presidential nomination   
they along with mcconnell are letting trump’s legal troubles unfold without coming to the former president’s defense in contrast to speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif and house majority leader steve scalise rla who both issued statements thursday criticizing the justice department before the indictment was unsealed to the public   
“they want him to go away so they wouldn’t be very upset if this is the thing that finally takes him out” a former senate republican aide said about the senate republican leaders’ silence on trump’s indictment

republican senators were more outspoken in defending trump in april after liberal manhattan district attorney alvin bragg unveiled an indictment charging him with 34 felony counts related to business records fraud   
even senate majority leader chuck schumer dny declined to express confidence in bragg when asked about him in late march  


  

special prosecutor jack smith whom attorney general merrick garland tapped in november to investigate trump has more credibility among republicans   
“jack smith is very credible” said the former senate gop aide  
“there is the reflection that he may have actually found finally the silver bullet” to end trump’s political career the former aide said noting that smith has a tape of trump acknowledging that he had retained classified documents after leaving office that he didn’t declassify while president

a senate republican aide said the indictment is “pretty damning”  
“the documents that he did have and who he was showing them to and where he was storing them is all pretty damning” the aide said “i don’t know if it will make a difference in the political landscape but it certainly seems pretty bad”  
the indictment accuses trump of showing a classified document laying out the military strategy for an attack against iran to a writer who didn’t have security clearance   


  

the former president also showed a sensitive military map to a staffer for his political action committee  
photos included in the indictment showed that trump haphazardly stashed boxes of sensitive materials around his residence at the maralago resort in florida including in a ballroom a bathroom a shower office space and his bedroom  
one photo showed documents scattered across the floor of a storage room   


  

nevertheless house republican leaders are speaking out forcefully against the indictment   
“this is going to disrupt the nation because it goes to the core of equal justice for all which is not being seen today and we’re not going to stand for it” mccarthy told  news in an interview friday  
scalise tweeted thursday evening “this sham indictment is the continuation of the endless political persecution of donald trump”  


  

former sen judd gregg rnh a onetime advisor to mcconnell’s leadership team and whose home state will host the second contest of next year’s republican presidential primary said the department of justice’s indictment may prove too much for trump to overcome  
“at some point there’s a straw that breaks the camel’s back and there’s a whole lot of straws on the back of donald trump right now” he said  
gregg called the legal problems facing trump clearly “outside the norm for a major leader of our nation”  


  

a new york jury last month found trump liable for sexual abuse and awarded his accuser the writer e jean carroll a 5 million judgment   
“most republicans want somebody else even trump people want somebody else because they want to win and they recognize trump is incapable of winning a general election at this point” gregg said   
he said senate republican leaders should call on the gop to move past the former president  
“i would be advising them to say ‘listen we have to move on as a party let donald trump work through his legal issues which are considerable but we as a party need to move on and let’s find ourselves a candidate for president who can win’” he said  
sen lisa murkowski ralaska on friday evening said the charges brought by the department of justice are “quite serious and cannot be casually dismissed”
she said in a statement that “mishandling classified documents is a federal crime because it can expose national secrets as well as the sources and methods they were obtained through”
murkowski who voted to convict trump on the impeachment charge of inciting the jan 6 2021 attack on the us capitol joined fellow republican sen mitt romney rutah in being the only two republican senators to criticize trump shortly after the indictment became public
romney who voted twice to convict trump on impeachment charges in 2020 and 2021 defended the justice department from criticisms voiced by other republicans that it is acting unfairly
“by all appearances the justice department and special counsel have exercised due care affording mr trump the time and opportunity to avoid charges that would not generally have been afforded to others” romney said in a statement  
“mr trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so” he said   
senate conservatives have come to trump’s defense notably sens josh hawley rmo ted cruz rtexas and mike lee rutah   
“the biden administration’s actions can only be compared to the type of oppressive tactics routinely seen in nations such as venezuela bolivia and nicaragua which are absolutely alien and unacceptable in america” lee said in a statement “it is an affront to our country’s glorious 246year legacy of independence from tyranny for the incumbent president of the united states to leverage the machinery of justice against a political rival”   
cruz speaking on his “the verdict” podcast called the indictment “an assault on democracy” “garbage” and “a political attack from a thoroughly corrupted and weaponized department of justice”  
senate republican conference chairman john barrasso rwyo the thirdranking member of the senate gop leadership who voted against the debt deal and is seen within the senate gop conference as someone who has tried to ally himself with its most conservative members also criticized the indictment   
“this indictment certainly looks like an unequal application of justice” he said in a statement pointing out that “large amounts of classified materials were found in president biden’s garage in delaware” yet “no indictment”   
yet many other republican senators particularly those more closely allied with mcconnell are staying conspicuously quiet about trump’s legal travails  
one gop senator who requested anonymity defended the justice department pushing back on accusations that because garland is a biden appointee the prosecution is necessarily motivated by politics

Former President Trump took a jab at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Saturday for attempting to “change” his name, amid his campaign for the Republican nomination. 
DeSantis has faced questions about the correct pronunciation of his last name, as he has switched back and forth between two different versions in recent weeks: Dee-Santis and Deh-Santis.


  

“He’s changing his name. Now, it’s Dee-Santis,” Trump said at the North Carolina Republican Party Convention on Saturday. “And I put a little message out: Never change your name in the middle of a campaign. You don’t change your name in the middle of a campaign.”
Trump has previously mocked the Florida governor’s changing pronunciations of his own name, noting on Truth Social, “Actually, I like ‘Da’ better, a nicer flow, so I am happy he is changing it.”
“He gets very upset when people, including reporters, don’t pronounce it correctly,” the former president added, adding his favorite nickname for the Florida governor. “Therefore, he shouldn’t mind, DeSanctimonious?” 
The Florida governor has brushed off the nickname for the most part, saying earlier this year that “I kinda like it.”

“I don’t know how to spell the sanctimonious one. I don’t really know what it means, but I kinda like it, it’s long, it’s got a lot of vowels,” DeSantis told television host Piers Morgan in an interview in March. “We’ll go with that, that’s fine.” 
Still, DeSantis has largely evaded questions about how to correctly pronounce his name.


  

“This is ridiculous,” DeSantis told Fox News last week. “These stupid things. Listen, the way to pronounce my last name? Winner.”

editor’s note this report has been updated to clarify that the indictment accuses former president trump of showing a classified document about attacking iran to a writer without security clearance
senate republican leaders including sen mitch mcconnell rky are staying quiet about former president trump’s indictment on 37 criminal charges letting him twist in the wind and breaking with house republican leaders who have rushed to trump’s defense   


  

mcconnell who is careful not to comment on trump or even repeat his name in public has said to his gop colleagues that he wants his party to turn the page on the former president whom he sees as a flawed general election candidate and a drag on senate republican candidates    
the senate gop leader’s top deputiessenate republican whip john thune sd and sen john cornyn rtexashave also indicated they don’t want trump to win the party’s 2024 presidential nomination   
they along with mcconnell are letting trump’s legal troubles unfold without coming to the former president’s defense in contrast to speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif and house majority leader steve scalise rla who both issued statements thursday criticizing the justice department before the indictment was unsealed to the public   
“they want him to go away so they wouldn’t be very upset if this is the thing that finally takes him out” a former senate republican aide said about the senate republican leaders’ silence on trump’s indictment

republican senators were more outspoken in defending trump in april after liberal manhattan district attorney alvin bragg unveiled an indictment charging him with 34 felony counts related to business records fraud   
even senate majority leader chuck schumer dny declined to express confidence in bragg when asked about him in late march  


  

special prosecutor jack smith whom attorney general merrick garland tapped in november to investigate trump has more credibility among republicans   
“jack smith is very credible” said the former senate gop aide  
“there is the reflection that he may have actually found finally the silver bullet” to end trump’s political career the former aide said noting that smith has a tape of trump acknowledging that he had retained classified documents after leaving office that he didn’t declassify while president

a senate republican aide said the indictment is “pretty damning”  
“the documents that he did have and who he was showing them to and where he was storing them is all pretty damning” the aide said “i don’t know if it will make a difference in the political landscape but it certainly seems pretty bad”  
the indictment accuses trump of showing a classified document laying out the military strategy for an attack against iran to a writer who didn’t have security clearance   


  

the former president also showed a sensitive military map to a staffer for his political action committee  
photos included in the indictment showed that trump haphazardly stashed boxes of sensitive materials around his residence at the maralago resort in florida including in a ballroom a bathroom a shower office space and his bedroom  
one photo showed documents scattered across the floor of a storage room   


  

nevertheless house republican leaders are speaking out forcefully against the indictment   
“this is going to disrupt the nation because it goes to the core of equal justice for all which is not being seen today and we’re not going to stand for it” mccarthy told  news in an interview friday  
scalise tweeted thursday evening “this sham indictment is the continuation of the endless political persecution of donald trump”  


  

former sen judd gregg rnh a onetime advisor to mcconnell’s leadership team and whose home state will host the second contest of next year’s republican presidential primary said the department of justice’s indictment may prove too much for trump to overcome  
“at some point there’s a straw that breaks the camel’s back and there’s a whole lot of straws on the back of donald trump right now” he said  
gregg called the legal problems facing trump clearly “outside the norm for a major leader of our nation”  


  

a new york jury last month found trump liable for sexual abuse and awarded his accuser the writer e jean carroll a 5 million judgment   
“most republicans want somebody else even trump people want somebody else because they want to win and they recognize trump is incapable of winning a general election at this point” gregg said   
he said senate republican leaders should call on the gop to move past the former president  
“i would be advising them to say ‘listen we have to move on as a party let donald trump work through his legal issues which are considerable but we as a party need to move on and let’s find ourselves a candidate for president who can win’” he said  
sen lisa murkowski ralaska on friday evening said the charges brought by the department of justice are “quite serious and cannot be casually dismissed”
she said in a statement that “mishandling classified documents is a federal crime because it can expose national secrets as well as the sources and methods they were obtained through”
murkowski who voted to convict trump on the impeachment charge of inciting the jan 6 2021 attack on the us capitol joined fellow republican sen mitt romney rutah in being the only two republican senators to criticize trump shortly after the indictment became public
romney who voted twice to convict trump on impeachment charges in 2020 and 2021 defended the justice department from criticisms voiced by other republicans that it is acting unfairly
“by all appearances the justice department and special counsel have exercised due care affording mr trump the time and opportunity to avoid charges that would not generally have been afforded to others” romney said in a statement  
“mr trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so” he said   
senate conservatives have come to trump’s defense notably sens josh hawley rmo ted cruz rtexas and mike lee rutah   
“the biden administration’s actions can only be compared to the type of oppressive tactics routinely seen in nations such as venezuela bolivia and nicaragua which are absolutely alien and unacceptable in america” lee said in a statement “it is an affront to our country’s glorious 246year legacy of independence from tyranny for the incumbent president of the united states to leverage the machinery of justice against a political rival”   
cruz speaking on his “the verdict” podcast called the indictment “an assault on democracy” “garbage” and “a political attack from a thoroughly corrupted and weaponized department of justice”  
senate republican conference chairman john barrasso rwyo the thirdranking member of the senate gop leadership who voted against the debt deal and is seen within the senate gop conference as someone who has tried to ally himself with its most conservative members also criticized the indictment   
“this indictment certainly looks like an unequal application of justice” he said in a statement pointing out that “large amounts of classified materials were found in president biden’s garage in delaware” yet “no indictment”   
yet many other republican senators particularly those more closely allied with mcconnell are staying conspicuously quiet about trump’s legal travails  
one gop senator who requested anonymity defended the justice department pushing back on accusations that because garland is a biden appointee the prosecution is necessarily motivated by politics

House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) sparred with CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday over former President Trump’s indictment in the Justice Department’s probe into his handling of classified documents.
Jordan firmly defended Trump during the segment, stressing that “the president’s ability to classify and control access to national security information flows from the Constitution” and that “he can put it wherever he wants, he can handle it however he wants.”


  

But Bash pushed back, noting a recording of Trump that revealed he acknowledged he couldn’t declassify documents once he was no longer in the White House.
“He says point blank on tape, ‘As president, I could have declassified it. Now I can’t.’ … It’s on tape as part of this indictment that he did not declassify the material,” Bash said of Trump, referring to a transcript of an audio recording obtained by CNN. 
“Saying he could have is not the same as saying he did it,” Jordan said.
“He said, ‘Now I can’t,'” Bash said. 
“Now he can’t — right, because he’s not president now. But when he was president he did declassify,” Jordan said.
“Which means that it’s classified. Which means that what he was holding was classified,” Bash said as the two talked over each other.


  

“Not if he declassified it when he was president of the United States, for goodness sake,” Jordan said. 
“But he’s saying point blank in this audio tape that he did not declassify it. What you’re saying just doesn’t make sense on its face,” Bash said.
Trump was indicted last week on 37 counts in connection to the mishandling of records as well as his efforts to prevent the government from recovering the documents after the end of his White House term, according to the unsealed indictment.

Bash repeatedly pressed Jordan over Trump appearing to admit he did not declassify documents, some of which had to do with the country’s military and foreign defense capabilities, U.S. nuclear programs and potential vulnerabilities of the U.S. and its allies. 
“Do you have evidence that the president — when he was president, now former president — actually declassified these documents before he took them?” Bash asked.
“I go on the president’s word and he said he did,” responded Jordan, who has consistently been one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress.

Former White House communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin said Monday that former President Trump’s indictment was worse than what his “greatest detractors” thought it could be.
“There’s liability that comes with representing Donald Trump,” Griffin said on CNN. “It’s the same reason he struggled to hire really credible staff even on the campaign and the reelection side of things because you expose yourself to things like Walt Nauta is now seeing, where you yourself can be guilty of committing a crime under his purview.”


  

“What I think I’m so struck by in this is this indictment, I think, is worse than Donald Trump’s greatest detractors could have dreamt up. Thirty-seven counts, the level of specificity, the details, the imagery, the pictures,” she added.
The Justice Department unveiled its indictment against Trump last week, charging him with 37 counts of mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence and his attempts to block the government from getting those documents. Nauta, one of his aides, was also charged in connection with the mishandling of documents.

Griffin, who served as the communications director under Trump, said it will ultimately come down to what kind of intelligence the documents contained, but “we’re talking nuclear secrets, five-eyes intelligence, the most sensitive intelligence sitting at a country club, in a bathroom with the chandelier.”
“This is a pretty clear-cut case in the eyes of just the American public. I don’t know how he’s going to find a strong defense,” she added.
Trump is headed to Florida on Monday to will make his first court appearance in connection to the charges he faces Tuesday. The federal charges he faces include sentences of up to 20 years in prison.

Former national security adviser John Bolton said the federal charges brought against former President Trump last week are “devastating,” adding the indictment should result in the end of Trump’s political career.
“This is a devastating indictment,” Bolton, who served under Trump, said Monday on CNN. “I speak here as an alumnus of the Justice Department myself, because not only is it powerful, it’s very narrowly tailored. They didn’t throw everything up against the wall to see what would stick that this really is a rifle shot. And I think it’s, it should be the end of Donald Trump’s political career.”

The Justice Department last week unveiled an indictment brought against the former president. It includes 37 counts of federal charges in connection with his handling of classified documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.
The indictment details how the former president allegedly sought to keep the classified documents from federal investigators, shared them with people without security clearances and improperly stored them.
Bolton said Trump may have taken the documents because he “may have just thought were cool.” He said he would have to see what was in the documents to answer the question of why Trump may have taken them.

He also suggested that while Trump will not push for a fast trial, he hopes the Justice Department will.

“I hoped the Justice Department really does try for a speedy trial, because frankly, the sooner it goes to a jury, and we find out their answer, whatever, whatever that answer is going to be the better for the country,” Bolton said. “Justice delayed, as they say, is justice denied, and the court should not let Donald Trump get the kind of delay I suspect he wants.”
Bolton on Friday also called on Trump to end his campaign for a second White House term, saying if the former president wanted what was best for the country, he would step aside.


  

“Donald Trump should immediately withdraw as a candidate for president,” Bolton tweeted. “Criminal charges are piling up around him. If Trump truly stood for America First policies, he would support the rule of law instead of continually flouting it. Withdraw now!”

Fox News legal analyst Jonathan Turley says former President Trump could die in prison if convicted on just one count after being indicted by the Justice Department last week on dozens of charges related to his handling of classified documents.  
“The problem is, he’s got to run the table — he’s 76 years old,” Turley, an opinion contributor for The Hill, said of Trump during an appearance on Fox News. “All the government has to do is stick the landing on one count, and he could have a terminal sentence. You’re talking about crimes that have a 10- or 20-year period as a maximum.”


  

Turley said the evidence laid out against Trump in the indictment revealed last week is “quite strong.” 
“Now, we have not heard their other side. Generally, the indictments are a lot stronger on the day they are issued than on the next day, so they may be able to knock down some of these issues,” Turley said. “But some of the evidence is coming from his former counsel, and these are very damaging statements made against him. It may be hard to move those.”
The indictment alleges Trump violated the Espionage Act, with federal prosecutors saying the president put “the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods,” at risk.
Trump is leaving his Bedminster, N.J., golf club Monday and heading to Miami, where he is slated to be arraigned on the charges against him Tuesday afternoon.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) pushed back on questioning from a CNN reporter about former president Trump’s recent federal indictment by bringing up hires the network has made of former federal law enforcement officials. 
“The idea of equal justice is not playing out here,” McCarthy said to a number of reporters gathered at the Capitol on Monday, pointing to CNN correspondent Lauren Fox and saying, “You’re with CNN right?” 


  

“Let’s take Andrew McCabe for example,” the speaker said, before Fox interrupted him saying, “but this is a different set of circumstances,” and pressing the Republican on if he was prepared to defend the former president. 
“Are you prepared to defend your network, CNN,” McCarthy shot back. “You can’t put words in my mouth even though your network hired Andrew McCabe who was fired from the FBI for leaking classified documents.” 
McCarthy also name dropped James Clapper, another federal law enforcement official turned cable news pundit who Trump regularly attacks. 
McCabe, a former FBI official, was hired by CNN as a contributor and is also frequently critical of Trump. 
After Friday’s federal indictment was revealed, McCabe described the former president’s alleged actions as “a spy’s dream.”

Federal prosecutors have accused Trump of jeopardizing national security with his handling of classified documents and charged the former president with 37 counts, most of which fall under potential violations of the Espionage Act.

The Justice Department last week unveiled an indictment brought against the former president. It includes 37 counts of federal charges in connection with his handling of classified documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.
The indictment details how the former president allegedly sought to keep the classified documents from federal investigators, shared them with people without security clearances and improperly stored them.
Bolton said Trump may have taken the documents because he “may have just thought were cool.” He said he would have to see what was in the documents to answer the question of why Trump may have taken them.

Bolton on Friday also called on Trump to end his campaign for a second White House term, saying if the former president wanted what was best for the country, he would step aside.

former national security adviser john bolton said the federal charges brought against former president trump last week are “devastating” adding the indictment should result in the end of trump’s political career
“this is a devastating indictment” bolton who served under trump said monday on  “i speak here as an alumnus of the justice department myself because not only is it powerful it’s very narrowly tailored they didn’t throw everything up against the wall to see what would stick that this really is a rifle shot and i think it’s it should be the end of donald trump’s political career”

the indictment details how the former president allegedly sought to keep the classified documents from federal investigators shared them with people without security clearances and improperly stored them
bolton said trump may have taken the documents because he “may have just thought were cool” he said he would have to see what was in the documents to answer the question of why trump may have taken them

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) pushed back on questioning from a CNN reporter about former president Trump’s recent federal indictment by bringing up hires the network has made of former federal law enforcement officials. 
“The idea of equal justice is not playing out here,” McCarthy said to a number of reporters gathered at the Capitol on Monday, pointing to CNN correspondent Lauren Fox and saying, “You’re with CNN right?” 


  

“Let’s take Andrew McCabe for example,” the speaker said, before Fox interrupted him saying, “but this is a different set of circumstances,” and pressing the Republican on if he was prepared to defend the former president. 
“Are you prepared to defend your network, CNN,” McCarthy shot back. “You can’t put words in my mouth even though your network hired Andrew McCabe who was fired from the FBI for leaking classified documents.” 
McCarthy also name dropped James Clapper, another federal law enforcement official turned cable news pundit who Trump regularly attacks. 
McCabe, a former FBI official, was hired by CNN as a contributor and is also frequently critical of Trump. 
After Friday’s federal indictment was revealed, McCabe described the former president’s alleged actions as “a spy’s dream.”

McCarthy and other House Republicans have blasted Trump’s indictment as political and suggested Trump is getting unfair treatment by President Biden’s Justice Department. 


  

Federal prosecutors have accused Trump of jeopardizing national security with his handling of classified documents and charged the former president with 37 counts, most of which fall under potential violations of the Espionage Act.

Fox News legal analyst Jonathan Turley says former President Trump could die in prison if convicted on just one count after being indicted by the Justice Department last week on dozens of charges related to his handling of classified documents.  
“The problem is, he’s got to run the table — he’s 76 years old,” Turley, an opinion contributor for The Hill, said of Trump during an appearance on Fox News. “All the government has to do is stick the landing on one count, and he could have a terminal sentence. You’re talking about crimes that have a 10- or 20-year period as a maximum.”


  

Turley said the evidence laid out against Trump in the indictment revealed last week is “quite strong.” 
“Now, we have not heard their other side. Generally, the indictments are a lot stronger on the day they are issued than on the next day, so they may be able to knock down some of these issues,” Turley said. “But some of the evidence is coming from his former counsel, and these are very damaging statements made against him. It may be hard to move those.”
The indictment alleges Trump violated the Espionage Act, with federal prosecutors saying the president put “the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods,” at risk.
Trump is leaving his Bedminster, N.J., golf club Monday and heading to Miami, where he is slated to be arraigned on the charges against him Tuesday afternoon.

Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said he would not support a convicted felon for president, as former President Trump faces an arraignment on federal charges over his alleged mishandling of classified and sensitive documents after his administration ended. 
Buck told CNN’s Dana Bash in an interview Tuesday that the public will need to see how the evidence for the case against Trump is presented and what Trump’s defense is, but he would not “feel comfortable” supporting someone who has been convicted of a felony for president. 


  




		The Hill Elections 2024 coverage	


“If he is convicted of these charges of mishandling this information, of knowingly concealing his actions, I don’t think — I certainly won’t support a convicted felon for the White House,” he said. 
Buck’s comment came before Trump made his first appearance in federal court in Miami, having been indicted on 37 counts related to his keeping classified and sensitive documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Fla. 
Most of the charges Trump is facing are for willful retention of national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act. Other counts he is facing include conspiracy to obstruct justice, concealing a document in a federal investigation and making false statements and representations. 
Republicans have been somewhat split in their reactions to Trump’s indictment in the days following the news that he would become the first former president to be charged with federal crimes. Some have criticized Trump’s conduct in allegedly keeping the documents in various places around Mar-a-Lago — including a bathroom — while others have accused the Justice Department of political motivation in going after Trump.

		Wildfire smoke makes weekend comeback as Canadian fires rage 	

Buck noted comments Trump previously made during the 2016 presidential election accusing his Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, of being unfit for office because of her handling of emails that contained classified information on a private server. 
“So, I think his words will set the standard that America will look at in determining whether he is fit for president,” he said. 


  

Buck said he believes the charges against Trump are “very serious” and that special counsel Jack Smith, who has been overseeing the probe into Trump, included a lot of detail to explain to the country why indicting him was necessary.

Anthony Scaramucci, who served as White House communications director under former President Trump, said Monday that he believes Trump is “stressed” about the indictment and predicted he will eventually drop out of the 2024 White House race.
“I know President Trump’s personality reasonably well,” Scaramucci said in an interview on NewsNation’s “Cuomo.” “Remember, it wasn’t just 11 days for me; it was 71 campaign stops and a full year’s worth of work. He does not like this. He is stressed about it.”


  

Scaramucci served in his White House role for just 11 days in July 2017 before being dismissed by the former president. He has since become an outspoken critic of Trump and said he is backing former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the 2024 election.

Despite Trump’s avowal to stay in the race, Scaramucci predicted that the former president would eventually bow out.
“I am going to say something contrarian on your show,” Scaramucci said Monday. “I think he ends up eventually dropping out of the race.”
“And I think he ends up coming up with some type of Spiro Agnew-like plea where he’s out, doesn’t go to jail,” he continued. “Something happens to him, but not too significant.” 



		The Hill Elections 2024 coverage	


Former Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in disgrace in 1973, pleading no contest to tax evasion in exchange for the dropping of political corruption charges. He faced a fine, probation and disbarment but did not go to jail.


  

“I don’t think he makes it to the Iowa caucus,” Scaramucci added. “So that’s a contrarian view. He says he’s going to be in it till the end.”
“But remember, his children, Ivanka, Jared, etc, they’re not with him this time,” he added. “I think that’s weighing on him.”
However, Trump has remained defiant in the face of his second indictment, saying he does not plan to leave the race even if convicted.

“I’ll never leave,” he told Politico on Saturday. “Look, if I would have left, I would have left prior to the original race in 2016. That was a rough one. In theory that was not doable.”
The former president is set to be arraigned in Miami on Tuesday over his alleged mishandling of classified materials.

Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) said he would not support a convicted felon for president, as former President Trump faces an arraignment on federal charges over his alleged mishandling of classified and sensitive documents after his administration ended. 
Buck told CNN’s Dana Bash in an interview Tuesday that the public will need to see how the evidence for the case against Trump is presented and what Trump’s defense is, but he would not “feel comfortable” supporting someone who has been convicted of a felony for president. 


  




		The Hill Elections 2024 coverage	


“If he is convicted of these charges of mishandling this information, of knowingly concealing his actions, I don’t think — I certainly won’t support a convicted felon for the White House,” he said. 
Buck’s comment came before Trump made his first appearance in federal court in Miami, having been indicted on 37 counts related to his keeping classified and sensitive documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Fla. 
Most of the charges Trump is facing are for willful retention of national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act. Other counts he is facing include conspiracy to obstruct justice, concealing a document in a federal investigation and making false statements and representations. 
Republicans have been somewhat split in their reactions to Trump’s indictment in the days following the news that he would become the first former president to be charged with federal crimes. Some have criticized Trump’s conduct in allegedly keeping the documents in various places around Mar-a-Lago — including a bathroom — while others have accused the Justice Department of political motivation in going after Trump.

Buck noted comments Trump previously made during the 2016 presidential election accusing his Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, of being unfit for office because of her handling of emails that contained classified information on a private server. 
“So, I think his words will set the standard that America will look at in determining whether he is fit for president,” he said. 


  

Buck said he believes the charges against Trump are “very serious” and that special counsel Jack Smith, who has been overseeing the probe into Trump, included a lot of detail to explain to the country why indicting him was necessary.

The head of the House Democratic Caucus went after Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Tuesday, accusing the GOP leader of reneging on a budget deal he cut with President Biden this month as part of the debt ceiling package.
Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) said McCarthy, by encouraging GOP appropriators to set 2024 spending levels below the caps agreed upon with Biden, has both defied the terms of the deal and increased the likelihood of a government shutdown later in the year. 


  

“It’s shocking that it took less than two weeks for Republicans to walk away from an agreement that they made,” Aguilar said during a press briefing in the Capitol. 
“This is an agreement that the Speaker made directly. And he took pains — remember? — to get everybody else out of the room and to get to a deal with just him and the president. And now he’s walking away from that deal,” Aguilar continued. “If it wasn’t so dangerous, it would be laughable.”
Asked if the GOP’s strategy heightens the risk of a government shutdown, Aguilar didn’t pause. 
“I think it very well could,” he said.
Under the debt ceiling agreement, McCarthy and Biden set caps on federal spending for fiscal 2024 — when outlays are essentially frozen at 2023 levels — and 2025, when a 1 percent increase would be in place.
Hard-line conservatives have bashed the legislation, saying it strays too far from the partisan debt ceiling package Republicans passed in late April, which featured much deeper cuts over a much longer window. The conservatives have accused McCarthy of caving to Biden on a top GOP priority, and now they want him to battle for steeper cuts as part of the effort to fund the government next year. 


  

McCarthy has responded to the pressure by emphasizing that the caps he negotiated with Biden merely represent an upper limit.
“You always have to remember with appropriation levels — that’s your cap. You can always do less,” McCarthy told reporters Monday in the Capitol.
Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas), chairwoman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, has adopted that same argument, issuing a statement Monday night saying she’ll be marking up spending bills below the Biden-McCarthy caps. She’s aiming to cut spending back to 2022 levels. 


  

“The Fiscal Responsibility Act set a topline spending cap – a ceiling, not a floor – for Fiscal Year 2024 bills,” Granger said. “That is why I will use this opportunity to mark up appropriations bills that limit new spending to the Fiscal Year 2022 topline level.”
That objective is estimated to cut federal spending by roughly $130 billion below current levels, raising questions about whether GOP leaders could rally the support from moderate GOP lawmakers who tend to support many of the programs likely to be affected. At this early stage, however, some of those moderates are downplaying those concerns. 
“There’s going to be a process; it will play itself out,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) said Tuesday.

Aguilar, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, noted that neither Biden nor the Democratic-led Senate will ever accept spending levels below those included in the debt ceiling agreement. With that in mind, he said House Republican leaders are forcing their rank-and-file members to take a politically risky vote on cuts to popular programs for one reason only: to prevent hard-line conservatives from going after McCarthy’s gavel. 
“The Senate is going to mark up to the deal that was made. And so House Republicans are going to completely make themselves irrelevant [and] make their members vote on these deep, deep cuts, and it has no possibility of becoming law,” Aguilar said. 
“[It’s] incredibly difficult to see that they want to put their members through this,” he added. “But these are the deals that Kevin McCarthy has to make in order to hold the gavel.”

Former U.N. ambassador and GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley said in an interview Tuesday that she’s “inclined in favor of a pardon” for former President Trump if he were to be convicted of federal charges stemming from his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House.
“I think we all need to let this trial play out. We need to see exactly what happens. When you look at a pardon, the issue is less about guilt and more about what’s good for the country. And I think it would be terrible for the country to have a former president in prison for years because of a documents case,” Haley said on “The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show” when asked if she’d commit to pardoning Trump if elected.


  

“That’s something you’d see in a Third World country. I saw that at the United Nations, so I would be inclined in favor of a pardon. But I think it’s really premature at this point when he’s not even been convicted of anything,” she added.
Trump appeared in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon after federal prosecutors alleged that Trump mishandled classified documents, which included information on the country’s national and military secrets.
The former president pleaded not guilty to the charges and has decried the probe as a “witch hunt.”

While the former U.N. ambassador reiterated her point that Trump was “incredibly reckless” if the charges in the federal indictment were true, Haley’s comments underscore the awkward position many 2024 GOP challengers are in as they seek to avoid defending their chief GOP White House rival while acknowledging a base of the Republican Party is still largely loyal to Trump.

“that’s something you’d see in a third world country i saw that at the united nations so i would be inclined in favor of a pardon but i think it’s really premature at this point when he’s not even been convicted of anything” she added
trump appeared in federal court in miami on tuesday afternoon after federal prosecutors alleged that trump mishandled classified documents which included information on the country’s national and military secrets
the former president pleaded not guilty to the charges and has decried the probe as a “witch hunt”

80,80,The Hill,Brett Samuels,Stephanie Grisham on Trump indictment: ‘He’s absolutely dejected’,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4048021-stephanie-grisham-on-trump-indictment-hes-absolutely-dejected/,2023-06-13T19:37:39Z,"Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham said she believes the former president is dejected about his indictment and court appearance.

Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham said she believes the former president is “dejected” about his indictment and court appearance.
“I think he’s absolutely dejected,” Grisham said on CNN on Tuesday ahead of his much-anticipated arraignment in Miami. “He doesn’t want to be arrested… He doesn’t like that. He thinks that it’s not elegant. He thinks that it takes away some of his power deep down.”


  

“But being Trump, he’s going to double, triple down as he’s been doing. He’s going to fundraise off of it. He’s going to play the victim.”
Officials said the former president technically was not “arrested” upon his arrival because he was appearing under a court summons but he was booked and fingerprinted ahead of a brief arraignment in which he entered a not guilty plea.
Grisham worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign before serving as press secretary to the first lady and later to the president. 
She was serving as chief of staff to former first lady Melania Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of the former president’s supporters descended on the Capitol, leading her to resign that same day.

Grisham later said that it was a mistake to work for Trump and released a book in October 2021 that was critical of the former president.
Trump pleaded not guilty to 37 counts related to his handling of classified documents at a courthouse in Miami on Tuesday. 


  

The indictment, which was unsealed on Friday, accused the former president of improperly retaining national defense information, sharing it with individuals who did not have proper security clearances, and blocking attempts by the federal government to recover the documents.

Editor’s note: This report has been updated to note that a state judge is overseeing former President Trump’s hush money case in Manhattan.
Former President Trump unleashed a torrent of insults directed at special counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday, hours after Trump pleaded not guilty to a 37-count indictment brought by Smith over the former president’s handling of classified materials after leaving office.


  

Trump, in a meandering and falsehood-filled speech from his Bedminster, N.J., property, levied personal attacks at Smith, who is overseeing the investigation into the former president.
Trump called Smith a “deranged lunatic,” a “thug,” and a “raging and uncontrolled Trump hater.”
“The prosecutor in the case, I will call our case, is a thug. I have named him ‘Deranged Jack Smith,’” Trump said. “He’s a behind-the-scenes guy, but his record is absolutely atrocious. He does political hit jobs.”
“He’s a raging and uncontrolled Trump hater, as is his wife, who happened to be the producer of that Michelle Obama puff piece. This is the guy I’ve got,” Trump said.
Smith, who previously prosecuted war crimes at The Hague, is married to Katy Chevigny, a documentary filmmaker who worked on a 2020 documentary about the former first lady.
The special counsel was reportedly in the courtroom earlier Tuesday as Trump entered his plea.


  

The former president’s diatribe against Smith aligns with what has become a habit of attacking judges and prosecutors who investigate his conduct or oversee his cases; a state judge overseeing Trump’s hush money case in Manhattan received death threats after the former president attacked him as a “Trump-hating judge.”
Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon to charges on 37 counts following a Department of Justice indictment alleging he violated the Espionage Act and obstructed justice in taking classified records from his presidency and refusing to return them.
Trump was indicted Thursday in connection with the investigation led by Smith, with the unsealed charging document revealing Trump would also be facing charges on concealing documents and making false statements.


  

The indictment alleged that Trump kept the documents in various rooms of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which frequently hosted large events and gatherings. It also alleged Trump on two separate occasions spoke about specific classified materials with staffers at his New Jersey club who did not have security clearances.

		Trump indictment lays bare security risks of storage at Mar-a-Lago 	

In his only public remarks on the indictment, Smith last week noted Trump should be presumed innocent until proven guilty and urged Americans to read the indictment for themselves.
“The men and women of the United States intelligence community and our Armed Forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people,” Smith said. “Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States, and they must be enforced. Violations of those laws put our country at risk.”

Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that Mike Simpson is a representative from Idaho.
Twenty House Republicans joined Democrats on Wednesday in voting to table a resolution to censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), breaking from the majority of the GOP conference on a measure that was backed by leadership.


  

The House voted 225-196-7 to effectively kill the measure, which was spearheaded by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.). It called for censuring and condemning Schiff “for conduct that misleads the American people in a way that is not befitting an elected Member of the House of Representatives.”
It also would have directed the Ethics Committee to conduct an investigation into Schiff’s “lies, misrepresentations, and abuses of sensitive information.”
Twenty Republicans voted with Democrats in favor of the motion to table: Reps. Kelly Armstrong (N.D.), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (Ore.), Juan Ciscomani (Ariz.), Tom Cole (Okla.), Warren Davidson (Ohio), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Kay Granger (Texas), Garret Graves (La.), Thomas Kean Jr. (N.J.), Kevin Kiley (Calif.), Young Kim (Calif.), Mike Lawler (N.Y.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Tom McClintock (Calif.), Mark Molinaro (N.Y.), Jay Obernolte (Calif.), Mike Simpson (Idaho), Mike Turner (Ohio), David Valadao (Calif.) and Steve Womack (Ark.).

Schiff, in comments after the vote, said he was “frankly surprised.”
“And I think it showed a lot of courage for Republican members to stand up to the crazy MAGA folks,” he said.
“I’m astounded by the vote frankly; it was basically almost 1 of 10 Republicans voted against this resolution,” Schiff later added.


  

“I thought it would certainly pass. Didn’t imagine they would set themselves up for another defeat on the floor. After the fiasco we saw last week.”

Massie signaled ahead of Wednesday’s vote that he would support the motion to table the censure resolution, zeroing in on a nonbinding “whereas” clause in the measure that said Schiff should be fined $16 million if the Ethics Committee finds that he “lied, made misrepresentations, and abused sensitive information.” That dollar figure, according to Luna, was half the amount of money American taxpayers paid to fund the investigation into potential collusion between Trump and Russia.
According to the Justice Department, special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation cost $32 million.


  

“Adam Schiff acted unethically but if a resolution to fine him $16 million comes to the floor I will vote to table it. (vote against it),” Massie wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning.
“The Constitution says the House may make its own rules but we can’t violate other (later) provisions of the Constitution. A $16 million fine is a violation of the 27th and 8th amendments,” he added in a subsequent tweet.
One notable GOP vote in favor of tabling the resolution was from Turner, the current chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who was the ranking member when Schiff led the panel during the last Congress. A number of allegations made against Schiff in the resolution stem back to his time as chairman and ranking member of the committee.


  

Earlier this year, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blocked Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) from serving on the Intelligence Committee, following through on a longtime promise.
Following Wednesday’s vote, Schiff said he was grateful to have Turner’s support.
“I’m grateful that he demonstrated the courage to do that and I appreciate the opportunity that I had to work with him on Intel,” Schiff said.

Five Democrats, all of whom sit on the House Ethics Committee, voted present: Reps. Mark DeSaulnier (Calif.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Glenn Ivey (Md.), Deborah Ross (N.C.) and Susan Wild (Pa.). Republican Reps. George Santos (N.Y.) and Darrell Issa (Calif.) also voted present.
Hours before the vote Wednesday, Santos posted a video on Twitter arguing that Schiff needed to be investigated. It is unclear why he ultimately voted present.

“To not carry out a censure would be a miscarriage of justice and a dereliction of our sworn duty as members of the House of Representatives. We must preserve the integrity of the U.S. House of Representatives and censure Adam Schiff today,” Santos said in the video.


  

Santos is, however, under investigation by the Ethics Committee amid questions about his finances.

according to the justice department special counsel robert mueller’s investigation cost 32 million


  

“adam schiff acted unethically but if a resolution to fine him 16 million comes to the floor i will vote to table it vote against it” massie wrote on twitter on wednesday morning
“the constitution says the house may make its own rules but we can’t violate other later provisions of the constitution a 16 million fine is a violation of the 27th and 8th amendments” he added in a subsequent tweet
one notable gop vote in favor of tabling the resolution was from turner the current chairman of the house intelligence committee who was the ranking member when schiff led the panel during the last congress a number of allegations made against schiff in the resolution stem back to his time as chairman and ranking member of the committee


  

earlier this year speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif blocked schiff and rep eric swalwell dcalif from serving on the intelligence committee following through on a longtime promise
following wednesday’s vote schiff said he was grateful to have turner’s support
“i’m grateful that he demonstrated the courage to do that and i appreciate the opportunity that i had to work with him on intel” schiff said

Fox News sent out a statement acknowledging a chyron that ran late Tuesday during former President Trump’s post-indictment remarks that called President Biden “wannabe dictator.”  
“WANNABE DICTATOR SPEAKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER HAVING HIS POLITICAL RIVAL ARRESTED,” the Fox News chyron read just before 9 p.m., as the network showed a split screen of both Biden speaking at the White House and and Trump giving remarks at his New Jersey golf club. 
“The chyron was taken down immediately and was addressed,” the network said in a statement to The Hill Wednesday afternoon. 
Fox, unlike competitors CNN and MSNBC, provided live continuous coverage of Trump’s remarks, during which he accused Biden of weaponizing the Department of Justice to “take out” his top political rival.

Google’s advertising business violates antitrust laws, European regulators said Wednesday, adding to the ongoing competition woes for the tech giant. 
The European Commission’s preliminary review of Google found the company violated EU antitrust rules by distorting competition in the advertising technology industry by allegedly favoring its display advertising technology services in a way that is detrimental to competing advertising technology services, advertisers and online publishers. 


  

The commission alleged that for nearly a decade, Google favored its ad exchange AdX in the ad selection auction run by its dominant ad server DFP by informing AdX in advance of the value of the best bid from competitors to win the auction. 
The commission also alleged Google favored its ad exchange by avoiding competing ad exchanges and making its exchange the most attractive. 
“Our preliminary concern is that Google may have used its market position to favour its own intermediation services,” Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of the European Commission, said in a statement. 
“Not only did this possibly harm Google’s competitors but also publishers’ interests, while also increasing advertisers’ costs. If confirmed, Google’s practices would be illegal under our competition rules,” she added. 
The EU’s allegation comes after the U.S. Department of Justice and a handful of states sued Google over its dominance in the digital ad space. The U.K.’s competition regulator is also investigating anti-competitive conduct by Google in the digital advertising market. 
Google pushed back on the claims in a blog post written by Google’s vice president of global ads Dan Taylor. 


  

“Today’s Statement of Objections from the European Commission sets out claims that are not new and relate to a narrow part of our advertising business. It fails to recognize how advanced advertising technology helps merchants reach customers and grow their businesses — while lowering costs and expanding choices for consumers,” Taylor wrote.

“The digital advertising market enjoys competitive pricing, lively innovation, and robust competition — helping advertisers, publishers, and consumers. We look forward to showing how our ad tech tools help make the internet open, and accessible — and how breaking them would diminish the availability of free, ad-supported content that benefits everyone,” Taylor added.
The company has previously pushed back on allegations raised in the U.S. over violating antitrust laws in the digital ad space.

Former Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday he could not defend the “very serious” allegations against former President Trump in a federal indictment over the handling of classified documents.
“Having read the indictment, these are very serious allegations. And I can’t defend what is alleged,” Pence said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal editorial board. “But the President is entitled to his day in court, he’s entitled to bring a defense, and I want to reserve judgment until he has the opportunity to respond.” 


  

Pence noted that the indictment alleges the documents Trump refused to turn over after leaving office included materials pertaining to U.S. military vulnerabilities and its nuclear program.
“Even the inadvertent release of that kind of information could compromise our national security and the safety of our armed forces,” Pence said. “And, frankly, having two members of our immediate family serving in the armed forces of the United States, I will never diminish the importance of protecting our nation’s secrets.”

The former vice president, who is running against Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, caveated that, “it’s hard for me to believe that politics didn’t play some role in this decision,” citing a Justice Department investigation into whether Trump’s 2016 campaign colluded with Russia that did not establish any coordination between the two sides.
Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon to charges on 37 counts from a Department of Justice indictment alleging he violated both the Espionage Act and obstructed justice in taking classified records from his presidency and refusing to return them.
Trump was indicted Thursday in connection with the investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith, with the unsealed charging document revealing Trump would also be facing charges on concealing documents and making false statements.

The indictment alleges Trump kept the documents in various rooms of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which frequently hosted large events and gatherings. It also alleges the former president on two separate occasions spoke about specific classified materials with staffers at his New Jersey club who did not have security clearances.


  

Pence, who is running well behind Trump in most GOP primary polls, had previously said he hoped the Justice Department would not move forward with an indictment, citing the likely divisions it would cause the country. He has since called for Attorney General Merrick Garland to explain the rationale behind the decision.
The former vice president was recently cleared of any wrongdoing by the Justice Department after a small number of classified documents were found at his Indiana residence in January. Pence’s team cooperated with law enforcement and turned the materials over upon their discovery.

Online sellers are smitten with Jack Smith, creating and potentially cashing in on everything from mugs to baby bibs inspired by the special counsel who indicted former President Trump. 
Smith’s glaring face is front and center on plenty of products that have popped up since he was appointed in November to investigate Trump’s handling of classified documents, as well as his actions in the wake of the 2020 election and surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. 


  

Now, as Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 37 federal charges, sellers say demand is even higher for Smith-related souvenirs. 
Scott Horner hawks a dozen items that double as odes to Smith on his website, classifiedshirts.com. His best-selling swag, Horner told ITK, is a play on the classic 1939 Jimmy Stewart film “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” Instead of Stewart’s grinning likeness, the $25 T-shirt features the special counsel’s stern-looking image.  
Horner said his “Jack Smith Fan Club” merchandise is also proving to be among the site’s top sellers. Another tee with Smith’s face includes the all-caps message, “Somebody’s gonna get Jacked up!” 
The inspiration for the products, Horner said, came “from seeing the excitement of people who are following this case when they started learning about the credentials of Jack Smith.” 
“I think people respect that Smith is not about politics, but a prosecutor that seek justice regardless of who the person is,” Horner said.  
The Orlando-based merchant said he saw a boost following Trump’s latest indictment, selling about 1,600 Smith items since the special counsel’s appointment last year.  


  

On Etsy, the shop LemonGoats is selling shirts bearing the words “Karma is Jack Smith.” 
The seller, located in Alabama, told ITK that after listing the $27 tee — which is a play on Taylor Swift’s song “Karma,” on Friday, they “had the first sale within an hour.” Since then, sales have increased each day. 
Other sites also peddle an assortment of Smith fan art. A “You don’t know Jack” design with Smith’s photo can be plastered on everything from $20 aprons to $31 baby blankets on Zazzle. “Jack Smith for President” shirts are for sale for $20 on RedBubble, along with a $3 “Jack Smith Democracy Defender” sticker that features a hand-drawn picture of the Department of Justice attorney. 


  

“Meet Jack, Jack Smith. He knows what he’s doing,” a description for the sticker reads. “He knows what everyone has been doing. Justice is coming.”

		Schwarzenegger: Trump won’t win in 2024	

The online Smith-selling craze harkens to 2017, when another otherwise obscure Department of Justice figure was quickly thrust into the spotlight. Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Trump’s ties to Russia, became the “it” guy in the online marketplace and a favorite among the 45th president’s fiercest critics. 
Mueller’s image appeared on countless products declaring everything from “It’s Mueller time” to “Merry Mueller holidays.” 


  

But after the 2019 release of Mueller’s report following a two-year investigation, the demand for merch with the 78-year-old former FBI director’s face on it seemingly died down. Now much of the Mueller merch is being offered at steep discounts, with several Etsy and Zazzle sellers unloading the products for 20 percent off.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said of former President Trump’s indictment that “the emperor has no clothes” and that Republicans should say so.
Bacon told reporters Tuesday ahead of Trump’s arraignment, in which he pleaded not guilty to the 37 federal charges filed against him, that the former president’s wrongdoing is “obvious” and Republicans must be honest about it.


  

He said Trump’s conduct in keeping thousands of pieces of secretive information at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida — allegedly showing documents he kept to other people who were not authorized to view them and telling investigators that he returned all the documents they requested when he actually only turned over some of them — is indefensible. 
“I just think the emperor has no clothes, and we need to have Republicans stand up and say that because, come around after the primary, I guarantee you the other party is going to be saying this,” Bacon said. 
Bacon, a moderate Republican who represents a hotly contested swing district in Nebraska, is one of a handful of Republicans who have criticized Trump’s conduct following his indictment. 
Many Republicans have defended Trump and slammed the Justice Department for alleged political motivation in prosecuting the former president, whom they point out is the leading contender for the GOP nomination to oppose President Biden’s reelection. 
That group includes several of Trump’s main opponents for the GOP nomination, including former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and conservative entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Ramaswamy has vowed to pardon Trump if elected president. 
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, two other GOP presidential candidates, have slammed Trump’s actions, with Hutchinson calling on him to drop out of the race.

Bacon said Republicans refusing to acknowledge the seriousness of the charges Trump faces could cost the party the presidential election in 2024. 
Trump called for a conservative primary challenger to oppose Bacon’s reelection bid during the 2022 midterms last January over Bacon’s support for Biden’s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. Trump initially called for challengers to Bacon and the dozen other Republicans who voted for the bill, but then he specifically singled out Bacon. 
Bacon easily won renomination last year before narrowly winning reelection in November.

Progressives who have watched Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tease the public are wondering what the lead up to the 2024 election could have looked like with a more credible primary challenger to President Biden.
Their discontent with Biden has grown after he cut what they see as a raw deal over the debt limit, and the latest snub from the president who’s now running as an outright centrist.  


  

While Kennedy appears to be having a moment, progressives don’t claim him for their cause. Rather, some wish that a more inspirational candidate would have given Biden a real run for the nomination, with a handful still hopeful someone will.  
“We are renewing efforts to encourage a progressive primary challenge from a visionary officeholder,” said Norman Solomon, a two-time delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “Or a major leader of social movements.”
That person hasn’t emerged yet. But it’s not for a lack of desire.

Democratic primary voters have repeatedly said they would consider another choice over Biden, noting that everything from his advanced age to his low approval ratings and handling of divisive issues such as immigration have been unhelpful. Activists have added to the criticism, insisting that his compromise-first approach is risky when facing a Republican Party yearning to defeat him.  
Democrats in Congress have been less pushy. They often note the good things the president has done, blame the GOP and have ultimately declined to recruit or coalesce around another candidate. While their actions don’t amount to a resounding endorsement, they’re enough to keep him afloat. 


  

Some of it is fear-based; Democrats generally don’t want to bruise Biden during a primary where few believe another contender could actually beat him. Those who hold that view think that a challenger could ultimately weaken his chances against former President Trump or another leading Republican for the nomination. None want to take away just enough votes on the margins to cause him to lose.

Over the past few weeks, however, the election has become even more volatile: Trump became the first former president to be federally indicted and insists he won’t drop out of the race. And while many Democrats see the 37 counts in his handling of classified documents as damning, some also believe Republicans will work to make the indictment look politically motivated by Biden and his Justice Department.
While Biden has kept his distance from the issue, other Democrats have been less inhibited. 


  

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has been among the highest profile figures to grab headlines. On Monday, he went on Fox News — a tactic progressives like Sanders and California Rep. Ro Khanna have used to send a message — and jousted with host Sean Hannity. 
Newsom is one of several progressives who says he is supporting Biden’s reelection effort but has nonetheless taken steps to target Trump and GOP governors and raise money for his side. Some say it looks a lot like campaign legwork.
“I think Newsom is preparing,” said Peter Daou, a progressive Democratic strategist who’s been a vocal critic of Biden. “Some other catalyst might have to happen for him to enter the race.”


  

Daou is one of just a few operatives who knows the challenges of working against the sitting president. He was recently involved with author Marianne Williamson’s presidential bid, where she has tried to push Biden to the left for the second consecutive cycle and get him and the Democratic National Committee to allow for a debate.
But despite progressives agreeing with much of Williamson’s platform, she hasn’t been able to get widespread attention or rise in the polls. 
Newsom, the highest-ranking executive from a massive liberal state, is in a different category, but his insistence in backing Biden in 2024 has led some to wonder if he’s actually playing a longer-term game. 


  

“There would have to be some other factor to change the dynamic,” Daou conceded about the California governor.
The lack of enthusiastic support for Biden has inspired Democrats to line up behind him in an effort to boost his chances.

Dozens of top figures across the ideological spectrum have pledged to help him, including working on ways to court and keep progressive voters and young people in his corner. While that effort is ongoing, voters are now confronted with an onslaught of Trump legal news, and some are seeing less familiar Democratic figures than Biden come into view.
Kennedy, for one, appears to be seizing on Biden apathy. He got attention last week when he talked to controversial Twitter owner Elon Musk in a conversation that was full of conspiracy theories and misinformation.
But Democrats warn that Biden’s orbit should not dismiss Kennedy completely. Many want to eye-roll his bid out of existence, but the unpredictable nature of the race makes that hard to do.

The same week that Kennedy blitzed the media, a top Sanders ally launched a third-party presidential bid — and is already eager to go head-to-head with Biden or Trump. 
“I would welcome a debate with any of the candidates!” Cornel West, a former Harvard scholar who served as a longtime surrogate for Sanders, told The Hill in a text message.
West opted against challenging Biden as a Democrat and instead registered with the People’s Party. In doing that, he got around the logistical hurdles that make primarying the sitting president a long shot.
While West is a fan favorite among many Sanders allies, the Vermont senator has stayed firmly committed to supporting Biden in 2024, a sign of the incumbent president’s grasp on the wing of the party that remains skeptical about him. 
“I think we have settled with him,” said one Democratic campaign strategist about Biden in the general election. “Progressives, regardless of how boisterous they are online, have settled into this notion.”

Those who are still holding out hope for another serious contender to take on Biden say it’s his policies and willingness to give in to Republicans that should be challenged, and that voters deserve another option.
“We need political courage, not timidity,” said Solomon, who also serves as national director of RootsAction.org. He recently changed the name of an anti-Biden effort from “Don’t Run Joe” to “Step Aside Joe” after the president formally relaunched his campaign. 
On Capitol Hill, left-wing frustration with Biden reached a boiling point over negotiations around the debt limit. For weeks, they had stressed that Biden shouldn’t bend to Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and some high-profile progressives voted against the deal on principle. 
“There’s no doubt that anger among grassroots progressives and frustration among progressive Congress members have intensified as a result of Biden’s acquiescence to the debt-ceiling blackmail and several recent White House decisions to exacerbate the climate crisis,” Solomon said. 
“The twin imperatives of defeating Republicans next year and making a decent future possible for the next generations require setting aside corporate status-quo approaches.”

progressives who have watched robert f kennedy jr tease the public are wondering what the lead up to the 2024 election could have looked like with a more credible primary challenger to president biden
their discontent with biden has grown after he cut what they see as a raw deal over the debt limit and the latest snub from the president who’s now running as an outright centrist  


  

while kennedy appears to be having a moment progressives don’t claim him for their cause rather some wish that a more inspirational candidate would have given biden a real run for the nomination with a handful still hopeful someone will  
“we are renewing efforts to encourage a progressive primary challenge from a visionary officeholder” said norman solomon a twotime delegate for sen bernie sanders ivt “or a major leader of social movements”
that person hasn’t emerged yet but it’s not for a lack of desire 

robert f kennedy jr departs after speaking at an antivaccine rally in washington dc on january 23 2022 stefani reynoldsafp via getty images
democratic primary voters have repeatedly said they would consider another choice over biden noting that everything from his advanced age to his low approval ratings and handling of divisive issues such as immigration have been unhelpful activists have added to the criticism insisting that his compromisefirst approach is risky when facing a republican party yearning to defeat him  
democrats in congress have been less pushy they often note the good things the president has done blame the gop and have ultimately declined to recruit or coalesce around another candidate while their actions don’t amount to a resounding endorsement they’re enough to keep him afloat 


  

some of it is fearbased democrats generally don’t want to bruise biden during a primary where few believe another contender could actually beat him those who hold that view think that a challenger could ultimately weaken his chances against former president trump or another leading republican for the nomination none want to take away just enough votes on the margins to cause him to lose 



		the hill elections 2024 coverage	


over the past few weeks however the election has become even more volatile trump became the first former president to be federally indicted and insists he won’t drop out of the race and while many democrats see the 37 counts in his handling of classified documents as damning some also believe republicans will work to make the indictment look politically motivated by biden and his justice department
while biden has kept his distance from the issue other democrats have been less inhibited 


  

california gov gavin newsom d has been among the highest profile figures to grab headlines on monday he went on  newsa tactic progressives like sanders and california rep ro khanna have used to send a messageand jousted with host sean hannity 
newsom is one of several progressives who says he is supporting biden’s reelection effort but has nonetheless taken steps to target trump and gop governors and raise money for his side some say it looks a lot like campaign legwork
“i think newsom is preparing” said peter daou a progressive democratic strategist who’s been a vocal critic of biden “some other catalyst might have to happen for him to enter the race”


  

daou is one of just a few operatives who knows the challenges of working against the sitting president he was recently involved with author marianne williamson’s presidential bid where she has tried to push biden to the left for the second consecutive cycle and get him and the democratic national committee to allow for a debate
but despite progressives agreeing with much of williamson’s platform she hasn’t been able to get widespread attention or rise in the polls 
newsom the highestranking executive from a massive liberal state is in a different category but his insistence in backing biden in 2024 has led some to wonder if he’s actually playing a longerterm game 


  

“there would have to be some other factor to change the dynamic” daou conceded about the california governor
the lack of enthusiastic support for biden has inspired democrats to line up behind him in an effort to boost his chances

dozens of top figures across the ideological spectrum have pledged to help him including working on ways to court and keep progressive voters and young people in his corner while that effort is ongoing voters are now confronted with an onslaught of trump legal news and some are seeing less familiar democratic figures than biden come into view
kennedy for one appears to be seizing on biden apathy he got attention last week when he talked to controversial twitter owner elon musk in a conversation that was full of conspiracy theories and misinformation
but democrats warn that biden’s orbit should not dismiss kennedy completely many want to eyeroll his bid out of existence but the unpredictable nature of the race makes that hard to do

the same week that kennedy blitzed the media a top sanders ally launched a thirdparty presidential bidand is already eager to go headtohead with biden or trump 
“i would welcome a debate with any of the candidates” cornel west a former harvard scholar who served as a longtime surrogate for sanders told the hill in a text message
west opted against challenging biden as a democrat and instead registered with the people’s party in doing that he got around the logistical hurdles that make primarying the sitting president a long shot
while west is a fan favorite among many sanders allies the vermont senator has stayed firmly committed to supporting biden in 2024 a sign of the incumbent president’s grasp on the wing of the party that remains skeptical about him 
“i think we have settled with him” said one democratic campaign strategist about biden in the general election “progressives regardless of how boisterous they are online have settled into this notion”

those who are still holding out hope for another serious contender to take on biden say it’s his policies and willingness to give in to republicans that should be challenged and that voters deserve another option
“we need political courage not timidity” said solomon who also serves as national director of rootsactionorg he recently changed the name of an antibiden effort from “don’t run joe” to “step aside joe” after the president formally relaunched his campaign 
on capitol hill leftwing frustration with biden reached a boiling point over negotiations around the debt limit for weeks they had stressed that biden shouldn’t bend to speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif and some highprofile progressives voted against the deal on principle 
“there’s no doubt that anger among grassroots progressives and frustration among progressive congress members have intensified as a result of biden’s acquiescence to the debtceiling blackmail and several recent white house decisions to exacerbate the climate crisis” solomon said 
“the twin imperatives of defeating republicans next year and making a decent future possible for the next generations require setting aside corporate statusquo approaches”

The Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest conservative caucus in the House, put a heavy focus on opposing “woke” policies in its annual model federal budget, while proposing $16.3 trillion in spending cuts over a decade.
The model budget for fiscal 2024, first shared with The Hill, includes policies that oppose gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and beyond, boost protections for religious institutions, and take aim at critical race theory — a framework that examines systemic racism in institutions.


  

“Nearly every major problem facing our nation can be traced back to a failure to budget,” said RSC Chairman Kevin Hern (R-Okla.).
“It all boils down to something we’ve heard the President say quite a few times this year: Show me your budget, and I’ll show you your values. Our values are clearly on display with this budget,” Hern said.
It would balance the federal budget in seven years, according to the caucus, while also cutting spending by $16.3 trillion and taxes by $5 trillion over a decade. It cuts spending slightly less and cuts taxes more than the group’s model budget from last year, which had $16.6 trillion in spending cuts and $3.9 trillion in tax cuts.
“The RSC Budget is a reflection of our commitment to defending our constitutional rights, championing conservative values, and safeguarding the foundational principles that make our country great,” Rep. Ben Cline (R-Va.), chair of the RSC Budget and Spending Task Force, said in a statement.
The caucus had delayed releasing its fiscal 2024 budget while House GOP leaders negotiated a debt limit increase and spending cut deal with the White House, not wanting to distract from leaders’ messaging on the matter.
The budget is an idealized proposal that does not necessarily reflect the House GOP caucus as a whole. But RSC proposals to raise the eligibility age for Medicare and the retirement age for Social Security became a major talking point for Democrats in the 2022 election cycle.


  

This year’s version pushes back on claims from the Biden administration that it supports cuts to benefits. It does not include any age increases for Medicare eligibility, but does include some “modest adjustments to the retirement age.”
Cline said that the retirement age would be increased at a rate of three months per year — but not for current or near-retirees — starting in 2026, until the retirement age reaches 69 for those turning 62 in 2033.
Leaders of the caucus stressed that the proposed entitlement reforms will require bipartisan cooperation, since Social Security is set to be insolvent in 2033 and Medicare is set to be insolvent in 2031.


  

“We would like to have support on engaging on these issues from the White House,” Cline said.
The annual framework is also an opportunity for the conservative group to go beyond the nitty-gritty in the federal budget and lay out its messaging priorities on social issues.
The RSC budget proposes eliminating the Committee on Racial Equity at the Treasury, a ban on what Republicans say are critical race theory-based training in the military, and a ban on federal funding going to entities that promote the theory. 


  

It also includes Rep. Greg Steube’s (R-Fla.) bill to ban transgender athletes in Title IX-funded womens’ sports, which passed earlier this year; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors; and a ban on federal funds being used for gender transition procedures.
The framework also has a measure that prevents the government from discriminating against faith-based institutions that provide adoption or foster care placements, a measure that opponents worry could undermine the ability of LGBTQ families to foster or adopt. Another included bill would protect the ability of leaders of religious institutions to make political statements without endangering their tax status.
Structural changes for how Congress deals with budget and spending matters are also included in the RSC budget blueprint.

It would require a reauthorization vote for mandatory spending outside of entitlements when estimated spending exceeds actual spending by a certain percentage. And it says the RSC supports Congressional rules that prohibit borrowing from trust funds to pay for other non-trust fund programs.
The RSC budget has traditionally received a vote in a GOP-controlled House, though it has failed in the past due to lack of GOP support. Hern said that GOP leadership has committed to hold a vote on approving the RSC budget this year.

House Democratic negotiators on Wednesday criticized a GOP-backed agriculture funding bill for fiscal 2024 while accusing Republicans of violating a spending deal struck between President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).
During a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday, lawmakers clashed for hours over proposals offered by Republicans to fund agriculture and rural development programs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other related agencies for the coming fiscal year.


  

“The bill before us is a perfect example of how House Republicans mislead the American people,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 
“They do not want to return critical domestic programs to the 2022 levels — they do not want to adhere to the bipartisan agreement set by the president and the Speaker, and which passed with many of their votes,” she added. 
Rep. Sanford Bishop Jr. (D-Ga.), ranking member on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, also called the bill “petty,” while noting a part of the measure he said that “blocks funding for the office of communication of the secretary of agriculture because of a press release he put out describing the impact of the Republican bill on the debt limits.” 
“This is absolutely ridiculous. It is retaliatory and it’s petty,” he said.
The bill proposes about $25.3 billion for such programs for fiscal 2024, or 2 percent less than the current levels and 12.5 percent lower than the amount Biden asked for in his budget request earlier this year. 
A chunk of the proposed funding would come from funds Republicans hope to claw back from previously approved spending for certain Democratic priorities. 


  

Republicans defending the bill say the measure would invest in rural communities and agricultural research, expand access to broadband, provide nutrition assistance to those in need while also putting a check on what they describe as “wasteful” spending. 
During the hearing, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), who heads the subcommittee tasked with crafting the agriculture funding proposal, touted funding for “critical infrastructure investments in water and wastewater systems, broadband and rural housing programs,” and called lawmakers to “work to right-size programs, especially since the pandemic is over.”
“President Biden has ended the public health emergency last month and this is why we’re returning the WIC cash value voucher benefits to a normal sustainable inflation adjusted funding level,” Harris argued, referring to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).


  

“The American Rescue Plan provided a one-time increase in these benefits due to the pandemic. But these increases continued to be built into the WIC program in fiscal ’22 and ’23,” he said, before noting funding would be cut for the program under the bills.
“With the end of the public health emergency, it’s time to return this program to normal operations,” he added.
Democrats criticized the proposed funding for the WIC program among other cuts, with Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) saying the measure would fund WIC “at a rate of 12.7 percent lower than what is needed to meet current participation and we have a growing population.”


  

“This shortage will result in more low birth weight babies and infant mortality,” she said. 
“And yes, this bill takes food out of the mouths of veterans, children, seniors and people with disabilities,” Kaptur continued.
Democrats also took issue with language from Republicans they said targets the FDA’s decision to allow mifepristone to be dispensed in some pharmacies.


  

“This policy rider would overrule the established scientific process for FDA approval to restrict women’s access to health care,” DeLauro said. 
“This move is unprecedented. The subcommittee has no business overturning the considered decision of the FDA just to make it harder for women to get an abortion,” she added.
Leaders on both sides agreed to spending caps for fiscal 2024 as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Congress passed the bill earlier this month to raise the debt limit before an early June deadline to prevent a national default.


  

However, since the bill’s passage, a growing number of conservatives have come out against the bipartisan plan, with some pushing for Republicans to revert funding back to fiscal 2022 levels — which would amount to much steeper cuts than previously agreed upon by both sides. 
Under a plan announced earlier this week, House Appropriations Chairwoman Kay Granger (R-Texas) affirmed the GOP-led spending panel would mark up the fiscal 2024 government funding bills at the fiscal 2022 top-line level.
The proposed limits are more in line with a separate bill — known as the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 — Republicans passed earlier this year to raise the debt limit, along with a host of partisan spending measures calling for more than $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade.


  

The agriculture funding bill considered Wednesday is one of 12 government funding bills that House Republicans are looking to move through the lower chamber in the months ahead as part of the annual appropriations process.

Congress has until the fiscal year ends in late September to pass its appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to buy more time for negotiations. 
Some lawmakers are already expecting Congress to blow past the deadline and pass a continuing resolution, as has been the case in previous years. However, there is added pressure this year thanks to the recent debt limit deal, which would trigger automatic cuts across the board if lawmakers don’t pass their spending bills by the end of the calendar year.

house democratic negotiators on wednesday criticized a gopbacked agriculture funding bill for fiscal 2024 while accusing republicans of violating a spending deal struck between president biden and speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif
during a house appropriations subcommittee hearing wednesday lawmakers clashed for hours over proposals offered by republicans to fund agriculture and rural development programs the food and drug administration fda and other related agencies for the coming fiscal year


  

“the bill before us is a perfect example of how house republicans mislead the american people” said rep rosa delauro dconn top democrat on the house appropriations committee 
“they do not want to return critical domestic programs to the 2022 levelsthey do not want to adhere to the bipartisan agreement set by the president and the speaker and which passed with many of their votes” she added 
rep sanford bishop jr dga ranking member on the house appropriations subcommittee on agriculture rural development food and drug administration also called the bill “petty” while noting a part of the measure he said that “blocks funding for the office of communication of the secretary of agriculture because of a press release he put out describing the impact of the republican bill on the debt limits” 
“this is absolutely ridiculous it is retaliatory and it’s petty” he said
the bill proposes about 253 billion for such programs for fiscal 2024 or 2 percent less than the current levels and 125 percent lower than the amount biden asked for in his budget request earlier this year 
a chunk of the proposed funding would come from funds republicans hope to claw back from previously approved spending for certain democratic priorities 


  

republicans defending the bill say the measure would invest in rural communities and agricultural research expand access to broadband provide nutrition assistance to those in need while also putting a check on what they describe as “wasteful” spending 
during the hearing rep andy harris rmd who heads the subcommittee tasked with crafting the agriculture funding proposal touted funding for “critical infrastructure investments in water and wastewater systems broadband and rural housing programs” and called lawmakers to “work to rightsize programs especially since the pandemic is over”
“president biden has ended the public health emergency last month and this is why we’re returning the wic cash value voucher benefits to a normal sustainable inflation adjusted funding level” harris argued referring to the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic


  

“the american rescue plan provided a onetime increase in these benefits due to the pandemic but these increases continued to be built into the wic program in fiscal ’22 and ’23” he said before noting funding would be cut for the program under the bills
“with the end of the public health emergency it’s time to return this program to normal operations” he added
democrats criticized the proposed funding for the wic program among other cuts with rep marcy kaptur dohio saying the measure would fund wic “at a rate of 127 percent lower than what is needed to meet current participation and we have a growing population”


  

“this shortage will result in more low birth weight babies and infant mortality” she said 
“and yes this bill takes food out of the mouths of veterans children seniors and people with disabilities” kaptur continued
democrats also took issue with language from republicans they said targets the fda’s decision to allow mifepristone to be dispensed in some pharmacies


  

“this policy rider would overrule the established scientific process for fda approval to restrict women’s access to health care” delauro said 
“this move is unprecedented the subcommittee has no business overturning the considered decision of the fda just to make it harder for women to get an abortion” she added
leaders on both sides agreed to spending caps for fiscal 2024 as part of the fiscal responsibility act congress passed the bill earlier this month to raise the debt limit before an early june deadline to prevent a national default


  

however since the bill’s passage a growing number of conservatives have come out against the bipartisan plan with some pushing for republicans to revert funding back to fiscal 2022 levelswhich would amount to much steeper cuts than previously agreed upon by both sides 
under a plan announced earlier this week house appropriations chairwoman kay granger rtexas affirmed the gopled spending panel would mark up the fiscal 2024 government funding bills at the fiscal 2022 topline level
the proposed limits are more in line with a separate billknown as the limit save grow act of 2023republicans passed earlier this year to raise the debt limit along with a host of partisan spending measures calling for more than 4 trillion in cuts over the next decade


  

the agriculture funding bill considered wednesday is one of 12 government funding bills that house republicans are looking to move through the lower chamber in the months ahead as part of the annual appropriations process

congress has until the fiscal year ends in late september to pass its appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to buy more time for negotiations 
some lawmakers are already expecting congress to blow past the deadline and pass a continuing resolution as has been the case in previous years however there is added pressure this year thanks to the recent debt limit deal which would trigger automatic cuts across the board if lawmakers don’t pass their spending bills by the end of the calendar year

Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that Mike Simpson is a representative from Idaho.
Twenty House Republicans joined Democrats on Wednesday in voting to table a resolution to censure Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), breaking from the majority of the GOP conference on a measure that was backed by leadership.


  

The House voted 225-196-7 to effectively kill the measure, which was spearheaded by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.). It called for censuring and condemning Schiff “for conduct that misleads the American people in a way that is not befitting an elected Member of the House of Representatives.”
It also would have directed the Ethics Committee to conduct an investigation into Schiff’s “lies, misrepresentations, and abuses of sensitive information.”
Twenty Republicans voted with Democrats in favor of the motion to table: Reps. Kelly Armstrong (N.D.), Lori Chavez-DeRemer (Ore.), Juan Ciscomani (Ariz.), Tom Cole (Okla.), Warren Davidson (Ohio), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Kay Granger (Texas), Garret Graves (La.), Thomas Kean Jr. (N.J.), Kevin Kiley (Calif.), Young Kim (Calif.), Mike Lawler (N.Y.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Tom McClintock (Calif.), Mark Molinaro (N.Y.), Jay Obernolte (Calif.), Mike Simpson (Idaho), Mike Turner (Ohio), David Valadao (Calif.) and Steve Womack (Ark.).

Schiff, in comments after the vote, said he was “frankly surprised.”
“And I think it showed a lot of courage for Republican members to stand up to the crazy MAGA folks,” he said.
“I’m astounded by the vote frankly; it was basically almost 1 of 10 Republicans voted against this resolution,” Schiff later added.


  

“I thought it would certainly pass. Didn’t imagine they would set themselves up for another defeat on the floor. After the fiasco we saw last week.”

Massie signaled ahead of Wednesday’s vote that he would support the motion to table the censure resolution, zeroing in on a nonbinding “whereas” clause in the measure that said Schiff should be fined $16 million if the Ethics Committee finds that he “lied, made misrepresentations, and abused sensitive information.” That dollar figure, according to Luna, was half the amount of money American taxpayers paid to fund the investigation into potential collusion between Trump and Russia.
According to the Justice Department, special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation cost $32 million.


  

“Adam Schiff acted unethically but if a resolution to fine him $16 million comes to the floor I will vote to table it. (vote against it),” Massie wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning.
“The Constitution says the House may make its own rules but we can’t violate other (later) provisions of the Constitution. A $16 million fine is a violation of the 27th and 8th amendments,” he added in a subsequent tweet.
One notable GOP vote in favor of tabling the resolution was from Turner, the current chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who was the ranking member when Schiff led the panel during the last Congress. A number of allegations made against Schiff in the resolution stem back to his time as chairman and ranking member of the committee.


  

Earlier this year, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) blocked Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) from serving on the Intelligence Committee, following through on a longtime promise.
Following Wednesday’s vote, Schiff said he was grateful to have Turner’s support.
“I’m grateful that he demonstrated the courage to do that and I appreciate the opportunity that I had to work with him on Intel,” Schiff said.

Five Democrats, all of whom sit on the House Ethics Committee, voted present: Reps. Mark DeSaulnier (Calif.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Glenn Ivey (Md.), Deborah Ross (N.C.) and Susan Wild (Pa.). Republican Reps. George Santos (N.Y.) and Darrell Issa (Calif.) also voted present.
Hours before the vote Wednesday, Santos posted a video on Twitter arguing that Schiff needed to be investigated. It is unclear why he ultimately voted present.

“To not carry out a censure would be a miscarriage of justice and a dereliction of our sworn duty as members of the House of Representatives. We must preserve the integrity of the U.S. House of Representatives and censure Adam Schiff today,” Santos said in the video.


  

Santos is, however, under investigation by the Ethics Committee amid questions about his finances.

The Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest conservative caucus in the House, put a heavy focus on opposing “woke” policies in its annual model federal budget, while proposing $16.3 trillion in spending cuts over a decade.
The model budget for fiscal 2024, first shared with The Hill, includes policies that oppose gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and beyond, boost protections for religious institutions, and take aim at critical race theory — a framework that examines systemic racism in institutions.


  

“Nearly every major problem facing our nation can be traced back to a failure to budget,” said RSC Chairman Kevin Hern (R-Okla.).
“It all boils down to something we’ve heard the President say quite a few times this year: Show me your budget, and I’ll show you your values. Our values are clearly on display with this budget,” Hern said.
It would balance the federal budget in seven years, according to the caucus, while also cutting spending by $16.3 trillion and taxes by $5 trillion over a decade. It cuts spending slightly less and cuts taxes more than the group’s model budget from last year, which had $16.6 trillion in spending cuts and $3.9 trillion in tax cuts.
“The RSC Budget is a reflection of our commitment to defending our constitutional rights, championing conservative values, and safeguarding the foundational principles that make our country great,” Rep. Ben Cline (R-Va.), chair of the RSC Budget and Spending Task Force, said in a statement.
The caucus had delayed releasing its fiscal 2024 budget while House GOP leaders negotiated a debt limit increase and spending cut deal with the White House, not wanting to distract from leaders’ messaging on the matter.
The budget is an idealized proposal that does not necessarily reflect the House GOP caucus as a whole. But RSC proposals to raise the eligibility age for Medicare and the retirement age for Social Security became a major talking point for Democrats in the 2022 election cycle.


  

This year’s version pushes back on claims from the Biden administration that it supports cuts to benefits. It does not include any age increases for Medicare eligibility, but does include some “modest adjustments to the retirement age.”
Cline said that the retirement age would be increased at a rate of three months per year — but not for current or near-retirees — starting in 2026, until the retirement age reaches 69 for those turning 62 in 2033.
Leaders of the caucus stressed that the proposed entitlement reforms will require bipartisan cooperation, since Social Security is set to be insolvent in 2033 and Medicare is set to be insolvent in 2031.


  

“We would like to have support on engaging on these issues from the White House,” Cline said.
The annual framework is also an opportunity for the conservative group to go beyond the nitty-gritty in the federal budget and lay out its messaging priorities on social issues.
The RSC budget proposes eliminating the Committee on Racial Equity at the Treasury, a ban on what Republicans say are critical race theory-based training in the military, and a ban on federal funding going to entities that promote the theory. 


  

It also includes Rep. Greg Steube’s (R-Fla.) bill to ban transgender athletes in Title IX-funded womens’ sports, which passed earlier this year; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors; and a ban on federal funds being used for gender transition procedures.
The framework also has a measure that prevents the government from discriminating against faith-based institutions that provide adoption or foster care placements, a measure that opponents worry could undermine the ability of LGBTQ families to foster or adopt. Another included bill would protect the ability of leaders of religious institutions to make political statements without endangering their tax status.
Structural changes for how Congress deals with budget and spending matters are also included in the RSC budget blueprint.

It would require a reauthorization vote for mandatory spending outside of entitlements when estimated spending exceeds actual spending by a certain percentage. And it says the RSC supports Congressional rules that prohibit borrowing from trust funds to pay for other non-trust fund programs.
The RSC budget has traditionally received a vote in a GOP-controlled House, though it has failed in the past due to lack of GOP support. Hern said that GOP leadership has committed to hold a vote on approving the RSC budget this year.

the republican study committee rsc the largest conservative caucus in the house put a heavy focus on opposing “woke” policies in its annual model federal budget while proposing 163 trillion in spending cuts over a decade
the model budget for fiscal 2024 first shared with the hill includes policies that oppose genderaffirming health care for transgender youth and beyond boost protections for religious institutions and take aim at critical race theorya framework that examines systemic racism in institutions


  

“nearly every major problem facing our nation can be traced back to a failure to budget” said rsc chairman kevin hern rokla
“it all boils down to something we’ve heard the president say quite a few times this year show me your budget and i’ll show you your values our values are clearly on display with this budget” hern said
it would balance the federal budget in seven years according to the caucus while also cutting spending by 163 trillion and taxes by 5 trillion over a decade it cuts spending slightly less and cuts taxes more than the group’s model budget from last year which had 166 trillion in spending cuts and 39 trillion in tax cuts
“the rsc budget is a reflection of our commitment to defending our constitutional rights championing conservative values and safeguarding the foundational principles that make our country great” rep ben cline rva chair of the rsc budget and spending task force said in a statement
the caucus had delayed releasing its fiscal 2024 budget while house gop leaders negotiated a debt limit increase and spending cut deal with the white house not wanting to distract from leaders’ messaging on the matter
the budget is an idealized proposal that does not necessarily reflect the house gop caucus as a whole but rsc proposals to raise the eligibility age for medicare and the retirement age for social security became a major talking point for democrats in the 2022 election cycle


  

this year’s version pushes back on claims from the biden administration that it supports cuts to benefits it does not include any age increases for medicare eligibility but does include some “modest adjustments to the retirement age”
cline said that the retirement age would be increased at a rate of three months per yearbut not for current or nearretireesstarting in 2026 until the retirement age reaches 69 for those turning 62 in 2033
leaders of the caucus stressed that the proposed entitlement reforms will require bipartisan cooperation since social security is set to be insolvent in 2033 and medicare is set to be insolvent in 2031


  

“we would like to have support on engaging on these issues from the white house” cline said
the annual framework is also an opportunity for the conservative group to go beyond the nittygritty in the federal budget and lay out its messaging priorities on social issues
the rsc budget proposes eliminating the committee on racial equity at the treasury a ban on what republicans say are critical race theorybased training in the military and a ban on federal funding going to entities that promote the theory 


  

it also includes rep greg steube’s rfla bill to ban transgender athletes in title ixfunded womens’ sports which passed earlier this year rep marjorie taylor greene’s rga bill to ban genderaffirming care for minors and a ban on federal funds being used for gender transition procedures
the framework also has a measure that prevents the government from discriminating against faithbased institutions that provide adoption or foster care placements a measure that opponents worry could undermine the ability of lgbtq families to foster or adopt another included bill would protect the ability of leaders of religious institutions to make political statements without endangering their tax status
structural changes for how congress deals with budget and spending matters are also included in the rsc budget blueprint

it would require a reauthorization vote for mandatory spending outside of entitlements when estimated spending exceeds actual spending by a certain percentage and it says the rsc supports congressional rules that prohibit borrowing from trust funds to pay for other nontrust fund programs

Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, called on the Energy Department’s Office of Inspector General to investigate Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm after she conceded to wrongly telling the committee she does not own individual stocks.
Granholm testified in April that she owns no individual stocks, but in a June 9 letter to committee chairman Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said she “mistakenly told the Committee that I did not own any individual stocks, whereas I should have said that I did not own any conflicting stocks.”


  

The Wyoming Republican also pointed to Granholm’s admission that, despite testifying that both she and her husband divested from Ford stock, her husband owned Ford stock in a separate account, which Granholm says was sold in May. Barrasso pointed to Granholm’s promotion of Ford’s electric vehicles during the period before that stock was sold.
Barrasso also cited her ownership of stock in electric vehicle manufacturer Proterra during a period in which President Biden and Vice President Harris promoted the company, as well as multiple violations of the STOCK Act, which requires disclosure of all stock sales within 45 days. The department has called the late stock disclosures, which were made in December 2021 despite the sales occurring from April to October, a “clerical error.”
“Secretary Granholm’s repeated noncompliance with established financial rules and regulations, in addition to her disregard for ethical standards, has contributed to the erosion of the public’s trust not only in her, but the Department of Energy as a whole,” Barrasso wrote.

“It is imperative that impropriety on the part of cabinet officials is taken seriously, the dignity of the offices in which they serve is upheld, and that officials are held accountable when they fail to follow the letter of the law,” he added.
In a statement, David Mayorga, the Energy Department’s director of public affairs, told The Hill, “Secretary Granholm always puts the interests of the American people first. As part of her commitment to the highest ethical conduct and transparency, Secretary Granholm timely divested of all conflicting assets that were known at the time of her confirmation, and subsequently even divested of assets she wasn’t legally required to sell. The Secretary is focused on delivering an equitable clean energy future that will bring cheaper power, cleaner air and more good-paying jobs for more Americans.”

Progressives who have watched Robert F. Kennedy Jr. tease the public are wondering what the lead up to the 2024 election could have looked like with a more credible primary challenger to President Biden.
Their discontent with Biden has grown after he cut what they see as a raw deal over the debt limit, and the latest snub from the president who’s now running as an outright centrist.  


  

While Kennedy appears to be having a moment, progressives don’t claim him for their cause. Rather, some wish that a more inspirational candidate would have given Biden a real run for the nomination, with a handful still hopeful someone will.  
“We are renewing efforts to encourage a progressive primary challenge from a visionary officeholder,” said Norman Solomon, a two-time delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “Or a major leader of social movements.”
That person hasn’t emerged yet. But it’s not for a lack of desire.

Democratic primary voters have repeatedly said they would consider another choice over Biden, noting that everything from his advanced age to his low approval ratings and handling of divisive issues such as immigration have been unhelpful. Activists have added to the criticism, insisting that his compromise-first approach is risky when facing a Republican Party yearning to defeat him.  
Democrats in Congress have been less pushy. They often note the good things the president has done, blame the GOP and have ultimately declined to recruit or coalesce around another candidate. While their actions don’t amount to a resounding endorsement, they’re enough to keep him afloat. 


  

Some of it is fear-based; Democrats generally don’t want to bruise Biden during a primary where few believe another contender could actually beat him. Those who hold that view think that a challenger could ultimately weaken his chances against former President Trump or another leading Republican for the nomination. None want to take away just enough votes on the margins to cause him to lose. 



		The Hill Elections 2024 coverage	


Over the past few weeks, however, the election has become even more volatile: Trump became the first former president to be federally indicted and insists he won’t drop out of the race. And while many Democrats see the 37 counts in his handling of classified documents as damning, some also believe Republicans will work to make the indictment look politically motivated by Biden and his Justice Department.
While Biden has kept his distance from the issue, other Democrats have been less inhibited. 


  

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has been among the highest profile figures to grab headlines. On Monday, he went on Fox News — a tactic progressives like Sanders and California Rep. Ro Khanna have used to send a message — and jousted with host Sean Hannity. 
Newsom is one of several progressives who says he is supporting Biden’s reelection effort but has nonetheless taken steps to target Trump and GOP governors and raise money for his side. Some say it looks a lot like campaign legwork.
“I think Newsom is preparing,” said Peter Daou, a progressive Democratic strategist who’s been a vocal critic of Biden. “Some other catalyst might have to happen for him to enter the race.”


  

Daou is one of just a few operatives who knows the challenges of working against the sitting president. He was recently involved with author Marianne Williamson’s presidential bid, where she has tried to push Biden to the left for the second consecutive cycle and get him and the Democratic National Committee to allow for a debate.
But despite progressives agreeing with much of Williamson’s platform, she hasn’t been able to get widespread attention or rise in the polls. 
Newsom, the highest-ranking executive from a massive liberal state, is in a different category, but his insistence in backing Biden in 2024 has led some to wonder if he’s actually playing a longer-term game. 


  

“There would have to be some other factor to change the dynamic,” Daou conceded about the California governor.
The lack of enthusiastic support for Biden has inspired Democrats to line up behind him in an effort to boost his chances.

Dozens of top figures across the ideological spectrum have pledged to help him, including working on ways to court and keep progressive voters and young people in his corner. While that effort is ongoing, voters are now confronted with an onslaught of Trump legal news, and some are seeing less familiar Democratic figures than Biden come into view.
Kennedy, for one, appears to be seizing on Biden apathy. He got attention last week when he talked to controversial Twitter owner Elon Musk in a conversation that was full of conspiracy theories and misinformation.
But Democrats warn that Biden’s orbit should not dismiss Kennedy completely. Many want to eye-roll his bid out of existence, but the unpredictable nature of the race makes that hard to do.

The same week that Kennedy blitzed the media, a top Sanders ally launched a third-party presidential bid — and is already eager to go head-to-head with Biden or Trump. 
“I would welcome a debate with any of the candidates!” Cornel West, a former Harvard scholar who served as a longtime surrogate for Sanders, told The Hill in a text message.
West opted against challenging Biden as a Democrat and instead registered with the People’s Party. In doing that, he got around the logistical hurdles that make primarying the sitting president a long shot.
While West is a fan favorite among many Sanders allies, the Vermont senator has stayed firmly committed to supporting Biden in 2024, a sign of the incumbent president’s grasp on the wing of the party that remains skeptical about him. 
“I think we have settled with him,” said one Democratic campaign strategist about Biden in the general election. “Progressives, regardless of how boisterous they are online, have settled into this notion.”

Those who are still holding out hope for another serious contender to take on Biden say it’s his policies and willingness to give in to Republicans that should be challenged, and that voters deserve another option.
“We need political courage, not timidity,” said Solomon, who also serves as national director of RootsAction.org. He recently changed the name of an anti-Biden effort from “Don’t Run Joe” to “Step Aside Joe” after the president formally relaunched his campaign. 
On Capitol Hill, left-wing frustration with Biden reached a boiling point over negotiations around the debt limit. For weeks, they had stressed that Biden shouldn’t bend to Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and some high-profile progressives voted against the deal on principle. 
“There’s no doubt that anger among grassroots progressives and frustration among progressive Congress members have intensified as a result of Biden’s acquiescence to the debt-ceiling blackmail and several recent White House decisions to exacerbate the climate crisis,” Solomon said. 
“The twin imperatives of defeating Republicans next year and making a decent future possible for the next generations require setting aside corporate status-quo approaches.”

progressives who have watched robert f kennedy jr tease the public are wondering what the lead up to the 2024 election could have looked like with a more credible primary challenger to president biden
their discontent with biden has grown after he cut what they see as a raw deal over the debt limit and the latest snub from the president who’s now running as an outright centrist  


  

while kennedy appears to be having a moment progressives don’t claim him for their cause rather some wish that a more inspirational candidate would have given biden a real run for the nomination with a handful still hopeful someone will  
“we are renewing efforts to encourage a progressive primary challenge from a visionary officeholder” said norman solomon a twotime delegate for sen bernie sanders ivt “or a major leader of social movements”
that person hasn’t emerged yet but it’s not for a lack of desire 

robert f kennedy jr departs after speaking at an antivaccine rally in washington dc on january 23 2022 stefani reynoldsafp via getty images
democratic primary voters have repeatedly said they would consider another choice over biden noting that everything from his advanced age to his low approval ratings and handling of divisive issues such as immigration have been unhelpful activists have added to the criticism insisting that his compromisefirst approach is risky when facing a republican party yearning to defeat him  
democrats in congress have been less pushy they often note the good things the president has done blame the gop and have ultimately declined to recruit or coalesce around another candidate while their actions don’t amount to a resounding endorsement they’re enough to keep him afloat 


  

some of it is fearbased democrats generally don’t want to bruise biden during a primary where few believe another contender could actually beat him those who hold that view think that a challenger could ultimately weaken his chances against former president trump or another leading republican for the nomination none want to take away just enough votes on the margins to cause him to lose 



		the hill elections 2024 coverage	


over the past few weeks however the election has become even more volatile trump became the first former president to be federally indicted and insists he won’t drop out of the race and while many democrats see the 37 counts in his handling of classified documents as damning some also believe republicans will work to make the indictment look politically motivated by biden and his justice department
while biden has kept his distance from the issue other democrats have been less inhibited 


  

california gov gavin newsom d has been among the highest profile figures to grab headlines on monday he went on  newsa tactic progressives like sanders and california rep ro khanna have used to send a messageand jousted with host sean hannity 
newsom is one of several progressives who says he is supporting biden’s reelection effort but has nonetheless taken steps to target trump and gop governors and raise money for his side some say it looks a lot like campaign legwork
“i think newsom is preparing” said peter daou a progressive democratic strategist who’s been a vocal critic of biden “some other catalyst might have to happen for him to enter the race”


  

daou is one of just a few operatives who knows the challenges of working against the sitting president he was recently involved with author marianne williamson’s presidential bid where she has tried to push biden to the left for the second consecutive cycle and get him and the democratic national committee to allow for a debate
but despite progressives agreeing with much of williamson’s platform she hasn’t been able to get widespread attention or rise in the polls 
newsom the highestranking executive from a massive liberal state is in a different category but his insistence in backing biden in 2024 has led some to wonder if he’s actually playing a longerterm game 


  

“there would have to be some other factor to change the dynamic” daou conceded about the california governor
the lack of enthusiastic support for biden has inspired democrats to line up behind him in an effort to boost his chances 

california gov gavin newsom speaks during a news conference in paramount calif monday may 1 2023 late monday june 12 2023 newsom sparred with  news host sean hannity insisting president joe biden is physically fit for a second term as president while refusing to say whether supporters have urged him to replace biden on the 2024 ballot hans gutknechtthe orange county register via ap file


  

dozens of top figures across the ideological spectrum have pledged to help him including working on ways to court and keep progressive voters and young people in his corner while that effort is ongoing voters are now confronted with an onslaught of trump legal news and some are seeing less familiar democratic figures than biden come into view
kennedy for one appears to be seizing on biden apathy he got attention last week when he talked to controversial twitter owner elon musk in a conversation that was full of conspiracy theories and misinformation
but democrats warn that biden’s orbit should not dismiss kennedy completely many want to eyeroll his bid out of existence but the unpredictable nature of the race makes that hard to do

the same week that kennedy blitzed the media a top sanders ally launched a thirdparty presidential bidand is already eager to go headtohead with biden or trump 
“i would welcome a debate with any of the candidates” cornel west a former harvard scholar who served as a longtime surrogate for sanders told the hill in a text message
west opted against challenging biden as a democrat and instead registered with the people’s party in doing that he got around the logistical hurdles that make primarying the sitting president a long shot
while west is a fan favorite among many sanders allies the vermont senator has stayed firmly committed to supporting biden in 2024 a sign of the incumbent president’s grasp on the wing of the party that remains skeptical about him 
“i think we have settled with him” said one democratic campaign strategist about biden in the general election “progressives regardless of how boisterous they are online have settled into this notion” 



		cornel west seeking green party nomination for presidential run	


those who are still holding out hope for another serious contender to take on biden say it’s his policies and willingness to give in to republicans that should be challenged and that voters deserve another option
“we need political courage not timidity” said solomon who also serves as national director of rootsactionorg he recently changed the name of an antibiden effort from “don’t run joe” to “step aside joe” after the president formally relaunched his campaign 
on capitol hill leftwing frustration with biden reached a boiling point over negotiations around the debt limit for weeks they had stressed that biden shouldn’t bend to speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif and some highprofile progressives voted against the deal on principle 
“there’s no doubt that anger among grassroots progressives and frustration among progressive congress members have intensified as a result of biden’s acquiescence to the debtceiling blackmail and several recent white house decisions to exacerbate the climate crisis” solomon said 
“the twin imperatives of defeating republicans next year and making a decent future possible for the next generations require setting aside corporate statusquo approaches”

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said of former President Trump’s indictment that “the emperor has no clothes” and that Republicans should say so.
Bacon told reporters Tuesday ahead of Trump’s arraignment, in which he pleaded not guilty to the 37 federal charges filed against him, that the former president’s wrongdoing is “obvious” and Republicans must be honest about it.


  

He said Trump’s conduct in keeping thousands of pieces of secretive information at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida — allegedly showing documents he kept to other people who were not authorized to view them and telling investigators that he returned all the documents they requested when he actually only turned over some of them — is indefensible. 
“I just think the emperor has no clothes, and we need to have Republicans stand up and say that because, come around after the primary, I guarantee you the other party is going to be saying this,” Bacon said. 
Bacon, a moderate Republican who represents a hotly contested swing district in Nebraska, is one of a handful of Republicans who have criticized Trump’s conduct following his indictment. 
Many Republicans have defended Trump and slammed the Justice Department for alleged political motivation in prosecuting the former president, whom they point out is the leading contender for the GOP nomination to oppose President Biden’s reelection. 
That group includes several of Trump’s main opponents for the GOP nomination, including former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and conservative entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. Ramaswamy has vowed to pardon Trump if elected president. 
Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, two other GOP presidential candidates, have slammed Trump’s actions, with Hutchinson calling on him to drop out of the race.

Bacon said Republicans refusing to acknowledge the seriousness of the charges Trump faces could cost the party the presidential election in 2024. 
Trump called for a conservative primary challenger to oppose Bacon’s reelection bid during the 2022 midterms last January over Bacon’s support for Biden’s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. Trump initially called for challengers to Bacon and the dozen other Republicans who voted for the bill, but then he specifically singled out Bacon. 
Bacon easily won renomination last year before narrowly winning reelection in November.

House Republicans are plowing forward with plans to mark up their funding bills at lower levels than the limits agreed upon with Democrats just weeks ago, teeing up what could be a nasty spending battle — and a potential government shutdown — later this year.
Democrats are fuming after House Republicans said this week that they plan to shoot for much lower than the top-line spending targets negotiated by President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as part of their deal to raise the debt limit.


  

Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters Tuesday the latest move across the aisle “all but guarantees a shutdown.” 
She said Republicans are seeking to cut tens of billions of dollars from the departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services, and others.
“This moves us in the direction of, you could say a [continuing resolution], but in October, we’re looking toward a shutdown,” DeLauro said.

Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), head of the House Democratic Caucus, also criticized McCarthy and accused Republicans of walking “away from an agreement that they made,” while arguing the move “very well could” heighten the risk of a government shutdown in the fall.
Leaders on both sides agreed to spending caps for fiscal 2024 as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Congress passed the bill earlier this month to raise the debt limit before an early June deadline to prevent a national default, but key spending cuts were necessary to win backing from Republicans.


  

Despite bipartisan support for the plan, the bill has been met with growing opposition from conservatives since its passage as hard-liners criticize the measure for not going far enough to curb spending.

The measure also emerged as a key issue among the Republican rebels who held up floor action in a recent revolt against House leaders. Conservatives have shifted their attention to the annual appropriations process in a bid to secure further cuts to spending.
“We have a very slim majority in the House,” Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), who serves on the Appropriations panel, told reporters Tuesday. 


  

“We have a conference that is all over the map on spending, and we all collectively would like to spend less, but we all have different ways we would spend less,” Womack continued. “So we’ve got to reconcile within the conference.”
Under the plan, House Appropriations Chairwoman Kay Granger (R-Texas) said the GOP-led spending panel would mark up the fiscal 2024 government funding bills at the fiscal 2022 top-line level.
The proposed limits are more in line with a separate bill — known as the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 — Republicans passed earlier this year to raise the debt limit, along with a host of partisan spending measures calling for more than $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade.


  

By comparison, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month that the debt ceiling deal could reduce projected deficits by about $1.5 trillion over the next decade.
There were immediate questions over how effective the deal’s spending limits would prove as the bill came together. Early chatter rose among some Senate Republicans around the prospect of supplemental funding for defense outside of the agreed-upon caps.
While Democrats have been quick to criticize the plan in both chambers, some GOP negotiators have been hesitant to render an opinion just yet.


  

“We’ll have to see what they do and how they do it, and then what we do about this compromise,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Tuesday. “So I think we’re a long way from making final judgments here.”

Capito added that bipartisan spending talks will be tougher under whichever path, but she told The Hill she thinks the House GOP plan could “definitely” make it more difficult for the party to secure further increases for their priorities in negotiations with Democrats.
At the same time, some conservatives say they think funding should be cut even further than the fiscal 2022 levels.


  

“I think we should be below the ‘22 spending level in the federal agencies,” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) told reporters on Tuesday. “And I don’t even like that ceiling.”
Senate Democrats have already signaled they plan to fight fiercely against the further proposed cuts, which Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told The Hill could make the annual task of preventing government shutdown “very difficult” for Congress in the months ahead.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) also signaled to The Hill on Tuesday that Democratic negotiators are strategizing a response.


  

“I think we’ll take a different approach. But we’ll know more because we’re kind of getting together informally this week to react to what we’re hearing from the House,” Baldwin said.

rep rosa delauro conn the top democrat on the house appropriations committee told reporters tuesday the latest move across the aisle “all but guarantees a shutdown” 
she said republicans are seeking to cut tens of billions of dollars from the departments of labor education health and human services and others
“this moves us in the direction of you could say a continuing resolution but in october we’re looking toward a shutdown” delauro said

rep pete aguilar calif head of the house democratic caucus also criticized mccarthy and accused republicans of walking “away from an agreement that they made” while arguing the move “very well could” heighten the risk of a government shutdown in the fall
leaders on both sides agreed to spending caps for fiscal 2024 as part of the fiscal responsibility act congress passed the bill earlier this month to raise the debt limit before an early june deadline to prevent a national default but key spending cuts were necessary to win backing from republicans


  

despite bipartisan support for the plan the bill has been met with growing opposition from conservatives since its passage as hardliners criticize the measure for not going far enough to curb spending

the measure also emerged as a key issue among the republican rebels who held up floor action in a recent revolt against house leaders conservatives have shifted their attention to the annual appropriations process in a bid to secure further cuts to spending
“we have a very slim majority in the house” rep steve womack rark who serves on the appropriations panel told reporters tuesday 


  

“we have a conference that is all over the map on spending and we all collectively would like to spend less but we all have different ways we would spend less” womack continued “so we’ve got to reconcile within the conference”
under the plan house appropriations chairwoman kay granger rtexas said the gopled spending panel would mark up the fiscal 2024 government funding bills at the fiscal 2022 topline level
the proposed limits are more in line with a separate billknown as the limit save grow act of 2023republicans passed earlier this year to raise the debt limit along with a host of partisan spending measures calling for more than 4 trillion in cuts over the next decade


  

by comparison the congressional budget office estimated last month that the debt ceiling deal could reduce projected deficits by about 15 trillion over the next decade
there were immediate questions over how effective the deal’s spending limits would prove as the bill came together early chatter rose among some senate republicans around the prospect of supplemental funding for defense outside of the agreedupon caps
while democrats have been quick to criticize the plan in both chambers some gop negotiators have been hesitant to render an opinion just yet


  

“we’ll have to see what they do and how they do it and then what we do about this compromise” sen shelley moore capito rwva said tuesday “so i think we’re a long way from making final judgments here”

capito added that bipartisan spending talks will be tougher under whichever path but she told the hill she thinks the house gop plan could “definitely” make it more difficult for the party to secure further increases for their priorities in negotiations with democrats
at the same time some conservatives say they think funding should be cut even further than the fiscal 2022 levels


  

“i think we should be below the ‘22 spending level in the federal agencies” rep byron donalds rfla told reporters on tuesday “and i don’t even like that ceiling”
senate democrats have already signaled they plan to fight fiercely against the further proposed cuts which senate majority whip dick durbin dill told the hill could make the annual task of preventing government shutdown “very difficult” for congress in the months ahead

House Democratic negotiators on Wednesday criticized a GOP-backed agriculture funding bill for fiscal 2024 while accusing Republicans of violating a spending deal struck between President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).
During a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday, lawmakers clashed for hours over proposals offered by Republicans to fund agriculture and rural development programs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other related agencies for the coming fiscal year.


  

“The bill before us is a perfect example of how House Republicans mislead the American people,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 
“They do not want to return critical domestic programs to the 2022 levels — they do not want to adhere to the bipartisan agreement set by the president and the Speaker, and which passed with many of their votes,” she added. 
Rep. Sanford Bishop Jr. (D-Ga.), ranking member on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, also called the bill “petty,” while noting a part of the measure he said that “blocks funding for the office of communication of the secretary of agriculture because of a press release he put out describing the impact of the Republican bill on the debt limits.” 
“This is absolutely ridiculous. It is retaliatory and it’s petty,” he said.
The bill proposes about $25.3 billion for such programs for fiscal 2024, or 2 percent less than the current levels and 12.5 percent lower than the amount Biden asked for in his budget request earlier this year. 
A chunk of the proposed funding would come from funds Republicans hope to claw back from previously approved spending for certain Democratic priorities. 


  

Republicans defending the bill say the measure would invest in rural communities and agricultural research, expand access to broadband, provide nutrition assistance to those in need while also putting a check on what they describe as “wasteful” spending. 
During the hearing, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), who heads the subcommittee tasked with crafting the agriculture funding proposal, touted funding for “critical infrastructure investments in water and wastewater systems, broadband and rural housing programs,” and called lawmakers to “work to right-size programs, especially since the pandemic is over.”
“President Biden has ended the public health emergency last month and this is why we’re returning the WIC cash value voucher benefits to a normal sustainable inflation adjusted funding level,” Harris argued, referring to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).


  

“The American Rescue Plan provided a one-time increase in these benefits due to the pandemic. But these increases continued to be built into the WIC program in fiscal ’22 and ’23,” he said, before noting funding would be cut for the program under the bills.
“With the end of the public health emergency, it’s time to return this program to normal operations,” he added.
Democrats criticized the proposed funding for the WIC program among other cuts, with Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) saying the measure would fund WIC “at a rate of 12.7 percent lower than what is needed to meet current participation and we have a growing population.”


  

“This shortage will result in more low birth weight babies and infant mortality,” she said. 
“And yes, this bill takes food out of the mouths of veterans, children, seniors and people with disabilities,” Kaptur continued.
Democrats also took issue with language from Republicans they said targets the FDA’s decision to allow mifepristone to be dispensed in some pharmacies.


  

“This policy rider would overrule the established scientific process for FDA approval to restrict women’s access to health care,” DeLauro said. 
“This move is unprecedented. The subcommittee has no business overturning the considered decision of the FDA just to make it harder for women to get an abortion,” she added.
Leaders on both sides agreed to spending caps for fiscal 2024 as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Congress passed the bill earlier this month to raise the debt limit before an early June deadline to prevent a national default.


  

However, since the bill’s passage, a growing number of conservatives have come out against the bipartisan plan, with some pushing for Republicans to revert funding back to fiscal 2022 levels — which would amount to much steeper cuts than previously agreed upon by both sides. 
Under a plan announced earlier this week, House Appropriations Chairwoman Kay Granger (R-Texas) affirmed the GOP-led spending panel would mark up the fiscal 2024 government funding bills at the fiscal 2022 top-line level.
The proposed limits are more in line with a separate bill — known as the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 — Republicans passed earlier this year to raise the debt limit, along with a host of partisan spending measures calling for more than $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade.


  

The agriculture funding bill considered Wednesday is one of 12 government funding bills that House Republicans are looking to move through the lower chamber in the months ahead as part of the annual appropriations process.

Congress has until the fiscal year ends in late September to pass its appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to buy more time for negotiations. 
Some lawmakers are already expecting Congress to blow past the deadline and pass a continuing resolution, as has been the case in previous years. However, there is added pressure this year thanks to the recent debt limit deal, which would trigger automatic cuts across the board if lawmakers don’t pass their spending bills by the end of the calendar year.

Fox News sent out a statement acknowledging a chyron that ran late Tuesday during former President Trump’s post-indictment remarks that called President Biden “wannabe dictator.”  
“WANNABE DICTATOR SPEAKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER HAVING HIS POLITICAL RIVAL ARRESTED,” the Fox News chyron read just before 9 p.m., as the network showed a split screen of both Biden speaking at the White House and and Trump giving remarks at his New Jersey golf club. 
“The chyron was taken down immediately and was addressed,” the network said in a statement to The Hill Wednesday afternoon. 
Fox, unlike competitors CNN and MSNBC, provided live continuous coverage of Trump’s remarks, during which he accused Biden of weaponizing the Department of Justice to “take out” his top political rival.

Online sellers are smitten with Jack Smith, creating and potentially cashing in on everything from mugs to baby bibs inspired by the special counsel who indicted former President Trump. 
Smith’s glaring face is front and center on plenty of products that have popped up since he was appointed in November to investigate Trump’s handling of classified documents, as well as his actions in the wake of the 2020 election and surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. 


  

Now, as Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday to 37 federal charges, sellers say demand is even higher for Smith-related souvenirs. 
Scott Horner hawks a dozen items that double as odes to Smith on his website, classifiedshirts.com. His best-selling swag, Horner told ITK, is a play on the classic 1939 Jimmy Stewart film “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” Instead of Stewart’s grinning likeness, the $25 T-shirt features the special counsel’s stern-looking image.  
Horner said his “Jack Smith Fan Club” merchandise is also proving to be among the site’s top sellers. Another tee with Smith’s face includes the all-caps message, “Somebody’s gonna get Jacked up!” 
The inspiration for the products, Horner said, came “from seeing the excitement of people who are following this case when they started learning about the credentials of Jack Smith.” 
“I think people respect that Smith is not about politics, but a prosecutor that seek justice regardless of who the person is,” Horner said.  
The Orlando-based merchant said he saw a boost following Trump’s latest indictment, selling about 1,600 Smith items since the special counsel’s appointment last year.  


  

On Etsy, the shop LemonGoats is selling shirts bearing the words “Karma is Jack Smith.” 
The seller, located in Alabama, told ITK that after listing the $27 tee — which is a play on Taylor Swift’s song “Karma,” on Friday, they “had the first sale within an hour.” Since then, sales have increased each day. 
Other sites also peddle an assortment of Smith fan art. A “You don’t know Jack” design with Smith’s photo can be plastered on everything from $20 aprons to $31 baby blankets on Zazzle. “Jack Smith for President” shirts are for sale for $20 on RedBubble, along with a $3 “Jack Smith Democracy Defender” sticker that features a hand-drawn picture of the Department of Justice attorney. 


  

“Meet Jack, Jack Smith. He knows what he’s doing,” a description for the sticker reads. “He knows what everyone has been doing. Justice is coming.”

		Schwarzenegger: Trump won’t win in 2024	

The online Smith-selling craze harkens to 2017, when another otherwise obscure Department of Justice figure was quickly thrust into the spotlight. Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Trump’s ties to Russia, became the “it” guy in the online marketplace and a favorite among the 45th president’s fiercest critics. 
Mueller’s image appeared on countless products declaring everything from “It’s Mueller time” to “Merry Mueller holidays.” 


  

But after the 2019 release of Mueller’s report following a two-year investigation, the demand for merch with the 78-year-old former FBI director’s face on it seemingly died down. Now much of the Mueller merch is being offered at steep discounts, with several Etsy and Zazzle sellers unloading the products for 20 percent off.

Editor’s note: This report has been updated to note that a state judge is overseeing former President Trump’s hush money case in Manhattan.
Former President Trump unleashed a torrent of insults directed at special counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday, hours after Trump pleaded not guilty to a 37-count indictment brought by Smith over the former president’s handling of classified materials after leaving office.


  

Trump, in a meandering and falsehood-filled speech from his Bedminster, N.J., property, levied personal attacks at Smith, who is overseeing the investigation into the former president.
Trump called Smith a “deranged lunatic,” a “thug,” and a “raging and uncontrolled Trump hater.”
“The prosecutor in the case, I will call our case, is a thug. I have named him ‘Deranged Jack Smith,’” Trump said. “He’s a behind-the-scenes guy, but his record is absolutely atrocious. He does political hit jobs.”
“He’s a raging and uncontrolled Trump hater, as is his wife, who happened to be the producer of that Michelle Obama puff piece. This is the guy I’ve got,” Trump said.
Smith, who previously prosecuted war crimes at The Hague, is married to Katy Chevigny, a documentary filmmaker who worked on a 2020 documentary about the former first lady.
The special counsel was reportedly in the courtroom earlier Tuesday as Trump entered his plea.


  

The former president’s diatribe against Smith aligns with what has become a habit of attacking judges and prosecutors who investigate his conduct or oversee his cases; a state judge overseeing Trump’s hush money case in Manhattan received death threats after the former president attacked him as a “Trump-hating judge.”
Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon to charges on 37 counts following a Department of Justice indictment alleging he violated the Espionage Act and obstructed justice in taking classified records from his presidency and refusing to return them.
Trump was indicted Thursday in connection with the investigation led by Smith, with the unsealed charging document revealing Trump would also be facing charges on concealing documents and making false statements.


  

The indictment alleged that Trump kept the documents in various rooms of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which frequently hosted large events and gatherings. It also alleged Trump on two separate occasions spoke about specific classified materials with staffers at his New Jersey club who did not have security clearances.

In his only public remarks on the indictment, Smith last week noted Trump should be presumed innocent until proven guilty and urged Americans to read the indictment for themselves.
“The men and women of the United States intelligence community and our Armed Forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people,” Smith said. “Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States, and they must be enforced. Violations of those laws put our country at risk.”

The Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest conservative caucus in the House, put a heavy focus on opposing “woke” policies in its annual model federal budget, while proposing $16.3 trillion in spending cuts over a decade.
The model budget for fiscal 2024, first shared with The Hill, includes policies that oppose gender-affirming health care for transgender youth and beyond, boost protections for religious institutions, and take aim at critical race theory — a framework that examines systemic racism in institutions.


  

“Nearly every major problem facing our nation can be traced back to a failure to budget,” said RSC Chairman Kevin Hern (R-Okla.).
“It all boils down to something we’ve heard the President say quite a few times this year: Show me your budget, and I’ll show you your values. Our values are clearly on display with this budget,” Hern said.
It would balance the federal budget in seven years, according to the caucus, while also cutting spending by $16.3 trillion and taxes by $5 trillion over a decade. It cuts spending slightly less and cuts taxes more than the group’s model budget from last year, which had $16.6 trillion in spending cuts and $3.9 trillion in tax cuts.
“The RSC Budget is a reflection of our commitment to defending our constitutional rights, championing conservative values, and safeguarding the foundational principles that make our country great,” Rep. Ben Cline (R-Va.), chair of the RSC Budget and Spending Task Force, said in a statement.
The caucus had delayed releasing its fiscal 2024 budget while House GOP leaders negotiated a debt limit increase and spending cut deal with the White House, not wanting to distract from leaders’ messaging on the matter.
The budget is an idealized proposal that does not necessarily reflect the House GOP caucus as a whole. But RSC proposals to raise the eligibility age for Medicare and the retirement age for Social Security became a major talking point for Democrats in the 2022 election cycle.


  

This year’s version pushes back on claims from the Biden administration that it supports cuts to benefits. It does not include any age increases for Medicare eligibility, but does include some “modest adjustments to the retirement age.”
Cline said that the retirement age would be increased at a rate of three months per year — but not for current or near-retirees — starting in 2026, until the retirement age reaches 69 for those turning 62 in 2033.
Leaders of the caucus stressed that the proposed entitlement reforms will require bipartisan cooperation, since Social Security is set to be insolvent in 2033 and Medicare is set to be insolvent in 2031.


  

“We would like to have support on engaging on these issues from the White House,” Cline said.
The annual framework is also an opportunity for the conservative group to go beyond the nitty-gritty in the federal budget and lay out its messaging priorities on social issues.
The RSC budget proposes eliminating the Committee on Racial Equity at the Treasury, a ban on what Republicans say are critical race theory-based training in the military, and a ban on federal funding going to entities that promote the theory. 


  

It also includes Rep. Greg Steube’s (R-Fla.) bill to ban transgender athletes in Title IX-funded womens’ sports, which passed earlier this year; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) bill to ban gender-affirming care for minors; and a ban on federal funds being used for gender transition procedures.
The framework also has a measure that prevents the government from discriminating against faith-based institutions that provide adoption or foster care placements, a measure that opponents worry could undermine the ability of LGBTQ families to foster or adopt. Another included bill would protect the ability of leaders of religious institutions to make political statements without endangering their tax status.
Structural changes for how Congress deals with budget and spending matters are also included in the RSC budget blueprint.

It would require a reauthorization vote for mandatory spending outside of entitlements when estimated spending exceeds actual spending by a certain percentage. And it says the RSC supports Congressional rules that prohibit borrowing from trust funds to pay for other non-trust fund programs.
The RSC budget has traditionally received a vote in a GOP-controlled House, though it has failed in the past due to lack of GOP support. Hern said that GOP leadership has committed to hold a vote on approving the RSC budget this year.

Former Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday he could not defend the “very serious” allegations against former President Trump in a federal indictment over the handling of classified documents.
“Having read the indictment, these are very serious allegations. And I can’t defend what is alleged,” Pence said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal editorial board. “But the President is entitled to his day in court, he’s entitled to bring a defense, and I want to reserve judgment until he has the opportunity to respond.” 


  

Pence noted that the indictment alleges the documents Trump refused to turn over after leaving office included materials pertaining to U.S. military vulnerabilities and its nuclear program.
“Even the inadvertent release of that kind of information could compromise our national security and the safety of our armed forces,” Pence said. “And, frankly, having two members of our immediate family serving in the armed forces of the United States, I will never diminish the importance of protecting our nation’s secrets.”

The former vice president, who is running against Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, caveated that, “it’s hard for me to believe that politics didn’t play some role in this decision,” citing a Justice Department investigation into whether Trump’s 2016 campaign colluded with Russia that did not establish any coordination between the two sides.
Trump pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon to charges on 37 counts from a Department of Justice indictment alleging he violated both the Espionage Act and obstructed justice in taking classified records from his presidency and refusing to return them.
Trump was indicted Thursday in connection with the investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith, with the unsealed charging document revealing Trump would also be facing charges on concealing documents and making false statements.

The indictment alleges Trump kept the documents in various rooms of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, which frequently hosted large events and gatherings. It also alleges the former president on two separate occasions spoke about specific classified materials with staffers at his New Jersey club who did not have security clearances.


  

Pence, who is running well behind Trump in most GOP primary polls, had previously said he hoped the Justice Department would not move forward with an indictment, citing the likely divisions it would cause the country. He has since called for Attorney General Merrick Garland to explain the rationale behind the decision.
The former vice president was recently cleared of any wrongdoing by the Justice Department after a small number of classified documents were found at his Indiana residence in January. Pence’s team cooperated with law enforcement and turned the materials over upon their discovery.

House Democratic negotiators on Wednesday criticized a GOP-backed agriculture funding bill for fiscal 2024 while accusing Republicans of violating a spending deal struck between President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).
During a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday, lawmakers clashed for hours over proposals offered by Republicans to fund agriculture and rural development programs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other related agencies for the coming fiscal year.


  

“The bill before us is a perfect example of how House Republicans mislead the American people,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 
“They do not want to return critical domestic programs to the 2022 levels — they do not want to adhere to the bipartisan agreement set by the president and the Speaker, and which passed with many of their votes,” she added. 
Rep. Sanford Bishop Jr. (D-Ga.), ranking member on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, also called the bill “petty,” while noting a part of the measure he said that “blocks funding for the office of communication of the secretary of agriculture because of a press release he put out describing the impact of the Republican bill on the debt limits.” 
“This is absolutely ridiculous. It is retaliatory and it’s petty,” he said.
The bill proposes about $25.3 billion for such programs for fiscal 2024, or 2 percent less than the current levels and 12.5 percent lower than the amount Biden asked for in his budget request earlier this year. 
A chunk of the proposed funding would come from funds Republicans hope to claw back from previously approved spending for certain Democratic priorities. 


  

Republicans defending the bill say the measure would invest in rural communities and agricultural research, expand access to broadband, provide nutrition assistance to those in need while also putting a check on what they describe as “wasteful” spending. 
During the hearing, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), who heads the subcommittee tasked with crafting the agriculture funding proposal, touted funding for “critical infrastructure investments in water and wastewater systems, broadband and rural housing programs,” and called lawmakers to “work to right-size programs, especially since the pandemic is over.”
“President Biden has ended the public health emergency last month and this is why we’re returning the WIC cash value voucher benefits to a normal sustainable inflation adjusted funding level,” Harris argued, referring to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).


  

“The American Rescue Plan provided a one-time increase in these benefits due to the pandemic. But these increases continued to be built into the WIC program in fiscal ’22 and ’23,” he said, before noting funding would be cut for the program under the bills.
“With the end of the public health emergency, it’s time to return this program to normal operations,” he added.
Democrats criticized the proposed funding for the WIC program among other cuts, with Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) saying the measure would fund WIC “at a rate of 12.7 percent lower than what is needed to meet current participation and we have a growing population.”


  

“This shortage will result in more low birth weight babies and infant mortality,” she said. 
“And yes, this bill takes food out of the mouths of veterans, children, seniors and people with disabilities,” Kaptur continued.
Democrats also took issue with language from Republicans they said targets the FDA’s decision to allow mifepristone to be dispensed in some pharmacies.


  

“This policy rider would overrule the established scientific process for FDA approval to restrict women’s access to health care,” DeLauro said. 
“This move is unprecedented. The subcommittee has no business overturning the considered decision of the FDA just to make it harder for women to get an abortion,” she added.
Leaders on both sides agreed to spending caps for fiscal 2024 as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Congress passed the bill earlier this month to raise the debt limit before an early June deadline to prevent a national default.


  

However, since the bill’s passage, a growing number of conservatives have come out against the bipartisan plan, with some pushing for Republicans to revert funding back to fiscal 2022 levels — which would amount to much steeper cuts than previously agreed upon by both sides. 
Under a plan announced earlier this week, House Appropriations Chairwoman Kay Granger (R-Texas) affirmed the GOP-led spending panel would mark up the fiscal 2024 government funding bills at the fiscal 2022 top-line level.
The proposed limits are more in line with a separate bill — known as the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 — Republicans passed earlier this year to raise the debt limit, along with a host of partisan spending measures calling for more than $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade.


  

The agriculture funding bill considered Wednesday is one of 12 government funding bills that House Republicans are looking to move through the lower chamber in the months ahead as part of the annual appropriations process.

Congress has until the fiscal year ends in late September to pass its appropriations bills or a continuing resolution to buy more time for negotiations. 
Some lawmakers are already expecting Congress to blow past the deadline and pass a continuing resolution, as has been the case in previous years. However, there is added pressure this year thanks to the recent debt limit deal, which would trigger automatic cuts across the board if lawmakers don’t pass their spending bills by the end of the calendar year.

Former George W. Bush aide Karl Rove warned in a new op-ed that former President Trump’s federal indictment over his mishandling of classified documents will come at a steep cost to himself and the country.
“No matter the outcome, America will pay a high price for the former president’s reckless petulance. So will he,” Rove wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.


  

Rove, who served as a senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to Bush, wrote that the country has been “plunged into an unprecedented crisis” after Trump was indicted on 37 felony counts last week. The former president pleaded not guilty to all 37 charges Tuesday as he maintains that the federal case against him is a “witch hunt” orchestrated by the weaponization of the government.
Rove said that this indictment is much more serious than Trump’s indictment in connection to falsifying business records in the Manhattan court, where he also pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records earlier this year.
“Unlike Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s charges of falsifying business records, this indictment is devastating in its rigor of evidence and the seriousness of the alleged crimes,” Rove wrote. “Even so, the case will further tear our country apart, as it has a heavy impact on the presidential campaign and—wrongly—undermines confidence in our justice system.”
“The blame for this calamity rests solely on Mr. Trump and his childish impulse to keep mementos from his time in the Oval Office, no matter what the law says,” he added.

Rove also wrote that when Trump’s trial is over, the county will face a “period of anger, division and recrimination” as some Republicans call for law enforcement agencies, like the FBI, to be eliminated. He said that the call to cut funding to an agency like the FBI is “no different than scrapping the San Francisco Police Department.”

He also suggested that if Trump did not take his “precious keepsakes,” then the country may have avoided the divisive aftermath of his indictment.


  

Rove, who is also a Fox News contributor, has criticized the former president in the past, saying in April that Trump’s focus on making fun of his rivals is “not smart.” He also said earlier this month that voters could learn a lot about political candidates by “how they trade blows,” pointing to Trump’s ongoing feud with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who announced his bid for the White House last month.

former george w bush aide karl rove warned in a new oped that former president trump’s federal indictment over his mishandling of classified documents will come at a steep cost to himself and the country
“no matter the outcome america will pay a high price for the former president’s reckless petulance so will he” rove wrote in a wall street journal oped


  

rove who served as a senior adviser and deputy chief of staff to bush wrote that the country has been “plunged into an unprecedented crisis” after trump was indicted on 37 felony counts last week the former president pleaded not guilty to all 37 charges tuesday as he maintains that the federal case against him is a “witch hunt” orchestrated by the weaponization of the government
rove said that this indictment is much more serious than trump’s indictment in connection to falsifying business records in the manhattan court where he also pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records earlier this year
“unlike manhattan district attorney alvin bragg’s charges of falsifying business records this indictment is devastating in its rigor of evidence and the seriousness of the alleged crimes” rove wrote “even so the case will further tear our country apart as it has a heavy impact on the presidential campaign and—wrongly—undermines confidence in our justice system”
“the blame for this calamity rests solely on mr trump and his childish impulse to keep mementos from his time in the oval office no matter what the law says” he added

Vanessa Chapoy had just turned 24 when she felt the lump in her breast. It was “huge,” she remembers, “like the size of a walnut, or a big marble.” She went to the first in a series of doctors that night to have it checked out. Two-and-a-half weeks later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Stage two, she would learn.
“And my whole world flipped upside down,” Chapoy says.


  

She entered a gauntlet of treatments: a lumpectomy to cut out the tumor and a portion of surrounding breast tissue, fertility treatments so she could freeze her eggs, five months of chemotherapy and then a double mastectomy to remove both of her breasts. 
Three years on, she’s still undergoing hormone therapy — an experience she likens to “early menopause” — and occasionally suffering from “chemo brain,” a form of brain fog resulting from chemotherapy that she says makes it more difficult for her to complete tasks or remember certain things.
“I don’t understand how this could happen,” she recalls telling a nurse at the beginning of it all. “I’m so young.”



		Special Report: Curing Cancer	


Cancer, after all, most often strikes late in life. In the United States, nearly 60 percent of patients are 65 or older when they’re diagnosed.
But stories like Chapoy’s are becoming more common. In recent decades, cancer rates have been climbing among people under 50, the typical cutoff for when cancer is considered “early-onset.”

This “early-onset cancer epidemic,” as one recent study published in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology dubbed it, comprises a surge in the incidence of over a dozen different cancers in younger people since the 1990s in countries around the world.


  

In the U.S., the rate of early-onset cases rose by almost 18 percent between 2000 and 2019, even as cancer declined slightly in older adults, according to data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Among Americans between 15 and 39 years old, an age group cancer researchers refer to as adolescents and young adults (AYAs), the surge was more pronounced still, topping 20 percent.
That increase has spanned genders, races and organs. It has stormed through young people’s blood and bone marrow, launched assaults on their gastrointestinal tracts, quartered itself in their reproductive organs. The incidence of breast cancer in Americans aged 15-39 rose more than 17 percent over the 19-year period. Myeloma rates spiked by over 30 percent. Colorectal cancer by nearly 45 percent.
Why? Cancer researchers aren’t entirely sure.


  

The rising rates are “probably partially attributable to increasing uptake of screening and early detection” in certain cancer types, especially thyroid cancer and prostate cancer, the authors of the Nature study noted.
Archie Bleyer, a clinical research professor at the Knight Cancer Institute of the Oregon Health & Science University, says the surge in cases of thyroid cancer, as well as kidney cancer, is at least partly a result of “overdiagnosis” due to increased screenings, both for cancer and for other health concerns. The screenings have detected tumors and masses in those organs that “look like cancer, so they’ve got to call it carcinoma,” he explains. But they “would never have been a problem if they were never picked up,” because they typically wouldn’t spread or progress. 
So “in some ways, it’s a false increase,” Bleyer says.

The surge in rates goes beyond what can be accounted for by increased screenings, however. Researchers hypothesize a slew of environmental and lifestyle changes since the mid-20th century have also driven a real rise in cases by increasing exposure to risk factors early in life.
The main suspect researchers point to is obesity, which has climbed steadily since the 1960s and become more common in childhood and adolescence. Many of the cancers rising among younger people have been tied to obesity, including breast cancer and uterine cancer, as well as colorectal cancer and several others impacting the gastrointestinal tract.
The increases in obesity-related cancers have been more “dramatic” than those among other types, suggesting obesity is a “big contributor” to the spike in early-onset cases, says Tomotaka Ugai, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the lead author of the Nature study. 


  

Beyond obesity itself, researchers believe a number of related factors could be involved: Westernized diets, sugar-sweetened beverages, red and processed meat, sedentary lifestyles, a decline in physical activity, metabolic conditions like type 2 diabetes.
And the list of suspects goes on. Bleyer says the increased use of diagnostic imaging such as CT scans and X rays, which expose patients to low levels of carcinogenic radiation, could be contributing, especially for cancers impacting the blood and bone marrow. When it comes to the uptick in testicular cancer, meanwhile, he says rising cannabis use is likely the leading culprit.

People growing taller could also be a risk factor for several cancer types, he says. Ugai tells me there’s speculation changes in our sleep patterns could be involved, though evidence is “quite limited.” Marios Giannakis, a medical oncologist and researcher at the Dana-Farber Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, says changes in the microbiome — the community of microorganisms that populate the body — have been “implicated” in the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer. These changes can result from diet, lifestyle factors or even surgical procedures such as C-sections.
Giannakis stresses that more research is needed to understand what’s behind the rising rates, including long-term prospective cohort studies that follow participants over extended periods of time. 
“Finding out the why could be very relevant for prevention,” Giannakis says.


  

But as research continues, more than 85,000 American adolescents and young adults are now being diagnosed with cancer each year. In 2020, Chapoy was one of the unlucky thousands. Two years later, I was. 
I went to the dermatologist for the first time in my life in August. Within twenty minutes of stepping into the exam room, I’d had a suspicious mole cut out of my forearm. I learned days later that I’d had melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. I was 27
My cancer was caught early and easily removed; a month after I first went to the dermatologist, all that remained of it was an inch-and-a-half-long scar and some haunting what-ifs. But that’s not the case for many adolescent and young adult patients. They’re often diagnosed at a more advanced stage, when cancer has already had time to grow and spread in the body. There are several reasons for that: They’re less likely to regularly visit the doctor than other patients. They’re more likely to be uninsured. And because cancer is relatively rare in the age group, it’s usually not top of mind for either doctors or patients as a possible explanation for symptoms. 
When Chapoy went to urgent care the night she found the lump in her breast, she said she was told, “It’s nothing to worry about. You’re probably ovulating.”
“It was a struggle getting the doctors to take me seriously at first,” she says. “If I had just listened to that first doctor, I wouldn’t be here.”
Despite the often late diagnoses, adolescents and young adults are more likely to survive their initial cancer diagnosis than older adults: More than 85 percent live to see the five-year mark, compared to 74 percent of 40- to 64-year-olds and fewer than 62 percent of those aged 65 and older.
But Chun Chao, a cancer epidemiologist with the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation, emphasizes that “the challenge for cancer survivors doesn’t stop when they complete their treatment.” 
Cancer can recur or progress. And young survivors also face a heightened threat of developing a second cancer or an array of other medical conditions, Chao says, including “cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, endocrine conditions, pulmonary diseases, liver disease, renal failure and musculoskeletal conditions.” In addition to those physical ailments, she notes survivors have an increased risk of severe depression or anxiety.
And the timing presents a unique set of challenges and disruptions to adolescent and young adult patients that extend beyond their health.
“They are at a transitional stage in life,” Chao says. “If you think about it, this is the age when people are trying to establish their independence. Some people are finishing up their education. People are trying to get their first job, just start to establish their career. And people are starting new families and starting to have kids. So at this particular age, having a cancer diagnosis can be a huge disruption to these goals.”
After Tatyana Ridgeway was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer when she was 26, she stepped away from work as she went through treatment: four cycles of chemotherapy and then proton radiation. Like Chapoy, she also underwent fertility treatments, as chemotherapy can negatively impact fertility and even cause early menopause.
The experience “shattered my idea of what parenthood was like. It shattered my idea of what your 20s are supposed to look like,” she says. “My ideas, my beliefs of, ‘By this age, we’re going to start trying for a kid, and then by this age, we want to be done,’ all of those plans fell off the shelf and just broke.”
She was able to preserve some embryos. But it was costly, she says. Her in vitro fertilization treatments were covered by insurance, but she had to take out a loan to cover the cost of cryopreservation. 
Her other treatments weren’t cheap either. Each of her four cycles of chemotherapy cost $15,000, and her proton radiation altogether cost over $100,000. “That’s without insurance,” she says. 
Chao notes that a “high proportion” of young adult survivors report financial hardships related to cancer, including “having to borrow money, going into debt or even filing for bankruptcy.”
Ridgeway, who is Black, says she also looked into cold cap therapy, which can help reduce hair loss brought on by chemotherapy. But she learned no one with her hair texture — “textured, curly, kinky hair” — had been included in trials for the therapy, and no one her age had been studied, either.
“There’s a lack of research specific to this age group,” says Alison Silberman, the CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that advocates for adolescents and young adults impacted by the disease. She describes the demographic as an “underserved and underrepresented population” when it comes to cancer.
“There has been a growing awareness” over the last couple of decades amid the increase in cases, she says. But it “depends on where you are. A lot of the larger academic institutions are well versed in AYA needs and challenges and differences. That doesn’t happen as much in the smaller community settings.” And she notes that while there’s “slightly more academic research,” there may still not be “as much clinical research.” 
“I think there’s still a lot of work to be done,” she says.
Researchers stress the importance of further raising awareness about cancer in the age group — among both young people themselves and their doctors — and studying their cases so treatment can be better tailored.
Danielle Carnival, the White House cancer moonshot coordinator, says the administration is “really focused on how to bridge the gap” in cancer care for adolescents and young adults, “both in understanding the science and helping serve those patients better.”
The administration is closely following research into potential causes for the increase in cases and prioritizing “decreasing the impact of preventable cancers,” she says, including by working to further lower smoking rates and by “looking at nutrition and lifestyle.”
Bleyer, of the Knight Cancer Institute, points to lung cancer and melanoma as “examples of how we can do better” at preventing early-onset cancer. Both have beaten against the current in recent years, growing scarcer in the young even as other cancers have become more common. Researchers have linked lung cancer’s drop-off to the decline in smoking, and melanoma’s to the embrace of sun protection.
For now, though, the overall rise in rates shows no sign of stopping. And it may be a canary in a coal mine.
“One of the reasons that we look at trends in younger adults is because it’s the best way to evaluate progress, because that’s where you first see changing patterns in cancer,” says Rebecca Siegel, a cancer epidemiologist and Senior Scientific Director of Surveillance Research at the American Cancer Society.
Several cancer researchers I spoke to agree: The age group now passing through adolescence and young adulthood, who were buffeted by a not yet fully understood cocktail of risk factors in the early years of their lives, will likely continue to suffer higher rates of cancer as they get older. 
It’s already happening, at least for colorectal cancer, Siegel says: Since 2010, advanced cancers of that type have become more common among Americans aged 50-64. 
“The younger people have elevated risk their whole life,” Siegel says. “As they age, they will carry that elevated risk with them.”

vanessa chapoy had just turned 24 when she felt the lump in her breast it was “huge” she remembers “like the size of a walnut or a big marble” she went to the first in a series of doctors that night to have it checked out twoandahalf weeks later she was diagnosed with breast cancer stage two she would learn
“and my whole world flipped upside down” chapoy says


  

she entered a gauntlet of treatments a lumpectomy to cut out the tumor and a portion of surrounding breast tissue fertility treatments so she could freeze her eggs five months of chemotherapy and then a double mastectomy to remove both of her breasts 
three years on she’s still undergoing hormone therapyan experience she likens to “early menopause”and occasionally suffering from “chemo brain” a form of brain fog resulting from chemotherapy that she says makes it more difficult for her to complete tasks or remember certain things
“i don’t understand how this could happen” she recalls telling a nurse at the beginning of it all “i’m so young”



		special report curing cancer	


cancer after all most often strikes late in life in the united states nearly 60 percent of patients are 65 or older when they’re diagnosed
but stories like chapoy’s are becoming more common in recent decades cancer rates have been climbing among people under 50 the typical cutoff for when cancer is considered “earlyonset”

this “earlyonset cancer epidemic” as one recent study published in nature reviews clinical oncology dubbed it comprises a surge in the incidence of over a dozen different cancers in younger people since the 1990s in countries around the world


  

in the us the rate of earlyonset cases rose by almost 18 percent between 2000 and 2019 even as cancer declined slightly in older adults according to data from the national cancer institute nci among americans between 15 and 39 years old an age group cancer researchers refer to as adolescents and young adults ayas the surge was more pronounced still topping 20 percent
that increase has spanned genders races and organs it has stormed through young people’s blood and bone marrow launched assaults on their gastrointestinal tracts quartered itself in their reproductive organs the incidence of breast cancer in americans aged 1539 rose more than 17 percent over the 19year period myeloma rates spiked by over 30 percent colorectal cancer by nearly 45 percent
why cancer researchers aren’t entirely sure


  

the rising rates are “probably partially attributable to increasing uptake of screening and early detection” in certain cancer types especially thyroid cancer and prostate cancer the authors of the nature study noted
archie bleyer a clinical research professor at the knight cancer institute of the oregon health  science university says the surge in cases of thyroid cancer as well as kidney cancer is at least partly a result of “overdiagnosis” due to increased screenings both for cancer and for other health concerns the screenings have detected tumors and masses in those organs that “look like cancer so they’ve got to call it carcinoma” he explains but they “would never have been a problem if they were never picked up” because they typically wouldn’t spread or progress 
so “in some ways it’s a false increase” bleyer says 


  


sign up for the latest from the hill here

the surge in rates goes beyond what can be accounted for by increased screenings however researchers hypothesize a slew of environmental and lifestyle changes since the mid20th century have also driven a real rise in cases by increasing exposure to risk factors early in life
the main suspect researchers point to is obesity which has climbed steadily since the 1960s and become more common in childhood and adolescence many of the cancers rising among younger people have been tied to obesity including breast cancer and uterine cancer as well as colorectal cancer and several others impacting the gastrointestinal tract
the increases in obesityrelated cancers have been more “dramatic” than those among other types suggesting obesity is a “big contributor” to the spike in earlyonset cases says tomotaka ugai an instructor at harvard medical school and brigham and women’s hospital and the lead author of the nature study 


  

beyond obesity itself researchers believe a number of related factors could be involved westernized diets sugarsweetened beverages red and processed meat sedentary lifestyles a decline in physical activity metabolic conditions like type 2 diabetes
and the list of suspects goes on bleyer says the increased use of diagnostic imaging such as ct scans and x rays which expose patients to low levels of carcinogenic radiation could be contributing especially for cancers impacting the blood and bone marrow when it comes to the uptick in testicular cancer meanwhile he says rising cannabis use is likely the leading culprit

people growing taller could also be a risk factor for several cancer types he says ugai tells me there’s speculation changes in our sleep patterns could be involved though evidence is “quite limited” marios giannakis a medical oncologist and researcher at the danafarber gastrointestinal cancer center says changes in the microbiomethe community of microorganisms that populate the bodyhave been “implicated” in the increase in earlyonset colorectal cancer these changes can result from diet lifestyle factors or even surgical procedures such as csections
giannakis stresses that more research is needed to understand what’s behind the rising rates including longterm prospective cohort studies that follow participants over extended periods of time 
“finding out the why could be very relevant for prevention” giannakis says


  

but as research continues more than 85000 american adolescents and young adults are now being diagnosed with cancer each year in 2020 chapoy was one of the unlucky thousands two years later i was 
i went to the dermatologist for the first time in my life in august within twenty minutes of stepping into the exam room i’d had a suspicious mole cut out of my forearm i learned days later that i’d had melanoma the deadliest form of skin cancer i was 27
my cancer was caught early and easily removed a month after i first went to the dermatologist all that remained of it was an inchandahalflong scar and some haunting whatifs but that’s not the case for many adolescent and young adult patients they’re often diagnosed at a more advanced stage when cancer has already had time to grow and spread in the body there are several reasons for that they’re less likely to regularly visit the doctor than other patients they’re more likely to be uninsured and because cancer is relatively rare in the age group it’s usually not top of mind for either doctors or patients as a possible explanation for symptoms 
when chapoy went to urgent care the night she found the lump in her breast she said she was told “it’s nothing to worry about you’re probably ovulating”
“it was a struggle getting the doctors to take me seriously at first” she says “if i had just listened to that first doctor i wouldn’t be here”
despite the often late diagnoses adolescents and young adults are more likely to survive their initial cancer diagnosis than older adults more than 85 percent live to see the fiveyear mark compared to 74 percent of 40 to 64yearolds and fewer than 62 percent of those aged 65 and older
but chun chao a cancer epidemiologist with the kaiser permanente southern california department of research  evaluation emphasizes that “the challenge for cancer survivors doesn’t stop when they complete their treatment” 
cancer can recur or progress and young survivors also face a heightened threat of developing a second cancer or an array of other medical conditions chao says including “cardiovascular diseases metabolic disorders endocrine conditions pulmonary diseases liver disease renal failure and musculoskeletal conditions” in addition to those physical ailments she notes survivors have an increased risk of severe depression or anxiety
and the timing presents a unique set of challenges and disruptions to adolescent and young adult patients that extend beyond their health
“they are at a transitional stage in life” chao says “if you think about it this is the age when people are trying to establish their independence some people are finishing up their education people are trying to get their first job just start to establish their career and people are starting new families and starting to have kids so at this particular age having a cancer diagnosis can be a huge disruption to these goals”
after tatyana ridgeway was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer when she was 26 she stepped away from work as she went through treatment four cycles of chemotherapy and then proton radiation like chapoy she also underwent fertility treatments as chemotherapy can negatively impact fertility and even cause early menopause
the experience “shattered my idea of what parenthood was like it shattered my idea of what your 20s are supposed to look like” she says “my ideas my beliefs of ‘by this age we’re going to start trying for a kid and then by this age we want to be done’ all of those plans fell off the shelf and just broke”
she was able to preserve some embryos but it was costly she says her in vitro fertilization treatments were covered by insurance but she had to take out a loan to cover the cost of cryopreservation 
her other treatments weren’t cheap either each of her four cycles of chemotherapy cost 15000 and her proton radiation altogether cost over 100000 “that’s without insurance” she says 
chao notes that a “high proportion” of young adult survivors report financial hardships related to cancer including “having to borrow money going into debt or even filing for bankruptcy”
ridgeway who is black says she also looked into cold cap therapy which can help reduce hair loss brought on by chemotherapy but she learned no one with her hair texture“textured curly kinky hair”had been included in trials for the therapy and no one her age had been studied either
“there’s a lack of research specific to this age group” says alison silberman the ceo of stupid cancer a nonprofit that advocates for adolescents and young adults impacted by the disease she describes the demographic as an “underserved and underrepresented population” when it comes to cancer
“there has been a growing awareness” over the last couple of decades amid the increase in cases she says but it “depends on where you are a lot of the larger academic institutions are well versed in aya needs and challenges and differences that doesn’t happen as much in the smaller community settings” and she notes that while there’s “slightly more academic research” there may still not be “as much clinical research” 
“i think there’s still a lot of work to be done” she says
researchers stress the importance of further raising awareness about cancer in the age groupamong both young people themselves and their doctorsand studying their cases so treatment can be better tailored
danielle carnival the white house cancer moonshot coordinator says the administration is “really focused on how to bridge the gap” in cancer care for adolescents and young adults “both in understanding the science and helping serve those patients better”
the administration is closely following research into potential causes for the increase in cases and prioritizing “decreasing the impact of preventable cancers” she says including by working to further lower smoking rates and by “looking at nutrition and lifestyle”
bleyer of the knight cancer institute points to lung cancer and melanoma as “examples of how we can do better” at preventing earlyonset cancer both have beaten against the current in recent years growing scarcer in the young even as other cancers have become more common researchers have linked lung cancer’s dropoff to the decline in smoking and melanoma’s to the embrace of sun protection
for now though the overall rise in rates shows no sign of stopping and it may be a canary in a coal mine
“one of the reasons that we look at trends in younger adults is because it’s the best way to evaluate progress because that’s where you first see changing patterns in cancer” says rebecca siegel a cancer epidemiologist and senior scientific director of surveillance research at the american cancer society
several cancer researchers i spoke to agree the age group now passing through adolescence and young adulthood who were buffeted by a not yet fully understood cocktail of risk factors in the early years of their lives will likely continue to suffer higher rates of cancer as they get older 
it’s already happening at least for colorectal cancer siegel says since 2010 advanced cancers of that type have become more common among americans aged 5064 
“the younger people have elevated risk their whole life” siegel says “as they age they will carry that elevated risk with them”

This “early-onset cancer epidemic,” as one recent study published in Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology dubbed it, comprises a surge in the incidence of over a dozen different cancers in younger people since the 1990s in countries around the world.


  

In the U.S., the rate of early-onset cases rose by almost 18 percent between 2000 and 2019, even as cancer declined slightly in older adults, according to data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Among Americans between 15 and 39 years old, an age group cancer researchers refer to as adolescents and young adults (AYAs), the surge was more pronounced still, topping 20 percent.
That increase has spanned genders, races and organs. It has stormed through young people’s blood and bone marrow, launched assaults on their gastrointestinal tracts, quartered itself in their reproductive organs. The incidence of breast cancer in Americans aged 15-39 rose more than 17 percent over the 19-year period. Myeloma rates spiked by over 30 percent. Colorectal cancer by nearly 45 percent.
Why? Cancer researchers aren’t entirely sure.


  

The rising rates are “probably partially attributable to increasing uptake of screening and early detection” in certain cancer types, especially thyroid cancer and prostate cancer, the authors of the Nature study noted.
Archie Bleyer, a clinical research professor at the Knight Cancer Institute of the Oregon Health & Science University, says the surge in cases of thyroid cancer, as well as kidney cancer, is at least partly a result of “overdiagnosis” due to increased screenings, both for cancer and for other health concerns. The screenings have detected tumors and masses in those organs that “look like cancer, so they’ve got to call it carcinoma,” he explains. But they “would never have been a problem if they were never picked up,” because they typically wouldn’t spread or progress. 
So “in some ways, it’s a false increase,” Bleyer says.

The surge in rates goes beyond what can be accounted for by increased screenings, however. Researchers hypothesize a slew of environmental and lifestyle changes since the mid-20th century have also driven a real rise in cases by increasing exposure to risk factors early in life.
The main suspect researchers point to is obesity, which has climbed steadily since the 1960s and become more common in childhood and adolescence. Many of the cancers rising among younger people have been tied to obesity, including breast cancer and uterine cancer, as well as colorectal cancer and several others impacting the gastrointestinal tract.
The increases in obesity-related cancers have been more “dramatic” than those among other types, suggesting obesity is a “big contributor” to the spike in early-onset cases, says Tomotaka Ugai, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the lead author of the Nature study. 


  

Beyond obesity itself, researchers believe a number of related factors could be involved: Westernized diets, sugar-sweetened beverages, red and processed meat, sedentary lifestyles, a decline in physical activity, metabolic conditions like type 2 diabetes.
And the list of suspects goes on. Bleyer says the increased use of diagnostic imaging such as CT scans and X rays, which expose patients to low levels of carcinogenic radiation, could be contributing, especially for cancers impacting the blood and bone marrow. When it comes to the uptick in testicular cancer, meanwhile, he says rising cannabis use is likely the leading culprit.

People growing taller could also be a risk factor for several cancer types, he says. Ugai tells me there’s speculation changes in our sleep patterns could be involved, though evidence is “quite limited.” Marios Giannakis, a medical oncologist and researcher at the Dana-Farber Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, says changes in the microbiome — the community of microorganisms that populate the body — have been “implicated” in the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer. These changes can result from diet, lifestyle factors or even surgical procedures such as C-sections.
Giannakis stresses that more research is needed to understand what’s behind the rising rates, including long-term prospective cohort studies that follow participants over extended periods of time. 
“Finding out the why could be very relevant for prevention,” Giannakis says.


  

But as research continues, more than 85,000 American adolescents and young adults are now being diagnosed with cancer each year. In 2020, Chapoy was one of the unlucky thousands. Two years later, I was. 
I went to the dermatologist for the first time in my life in August. Within twenty minutes of stepping into the exam room, I’d had a suspicious mole cut out of my forearm. I learned days later that I’d had melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. I was 27
My cancer was caught early and easily removed; a month after I first went to the dermatologist, all that remained of it was an inch-and-a-half-long scar and some haunting what-ifs. But that’s not the case for many adolescent and young adult patients. They’re often diagnosed at a more advanced stage, when cancer has already had time to grow and spread in the body. There are several reasons for that: They’re less likely to regularly visit the doctor than other patients. They’re more likely to be uninsured. And because cancer is relatively rare in the age group, it’s usually not top of mind for either doctors or patients as a possible explanation for symptoms. 
When Chapoy went to urgent care the night she found the lump in her breast, she said she was told, “It’s nothing to worry about. You’re probably ovulating.”
“It was a struggle getting the doctors to take me seriously at first,” she says. “If I had just listened to that first doctor, I wouldn’t be here.”
Despite the often late diagnoses, adolescents and young adults are more likely to survive their initial cancer diagnosis than older adults: More than 85 percent live to see the five-year mark, compared to 74 percent of 40- to 64-year-olds and fewer than 62 percent of those aged 65 and older.
But Chun Chao, a cancer epidemiologist with the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation, emphasizes that “the challenge for cancer survivors doesn’t stop when they complete their treatment.” 
Cancer can recur or progress. And young survivors also face a heightened threat of developing a second cancer or an array of other medical conditions, Chao says, including “cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, endocrine conditions, pulmonary diseases, liver disease, renal failure and musculoskeletal conditions.” In addition to those physical ailments, she notes survivors have an increased risk of severe depression or anxiety.
And the timing presents a unique set of challenges and disruptions to adolescent and young adult patients that extend beyond their health.
“They are at a transitional stage in life,” Chao says. “If you think about it, this is the age when people are trying to establish their independence. Some people are finishing up their education. People are trying to get their first job, just start to establish their career. And people are starting new families and starting to have kids. So at this particular age, having a cancer diagnosis can be a huge disruption to these goals.”
After Tatyana Ridgeway was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer when she was 26, she stepped away from work as she went through treatment: four cycles of chemotherapy and then proton radiation. Like Chapoy, she also underwent fertility treatments, as chemotherapy can negatively impact fertility and even cause early menopause.
The experience “shattered my idea of what parenthood was like. It shattered my idea of what your 20s are supposed to look like,” she says. “My ideas, my beliefs of, ‘By this age, we’re going to start trying for a kid, and then by this age, we want to be done,’ all of those plans fell off the shelf and just broke.”
She was able to preserve some embryos. But it was costly, she says. Her in vitro fertilization treatments were covered by insurance, but she had to take out a loan to cover the cost of cryopreservation. 
Her other treatments weren’t cheap either. Each of her four cycles of chemotherapy cost $15,000, and her proton radiation altogether cost over $100,000. “That’s without insurance,” she says. 
Chao notes that a “high proportion” of young adult survivors report financial hardships related to cancer, including “having to borrow money, going into debt or even filing for bankruptcy.”
Ridgeway, who is Black, says she also looked into cold cap therapy, which can help reduce hair loss brought on by chemotherapy. But she learned no one with her hair texture — “textured, curly, kinky hair” — had been included in trials for the therapy, and no one her age had been studied, either.
“There’s a lack of research specific to this age group,” says Alison Silberman, the CEO of Stupid Cancer, a nonprofit that advocates for adolescents and young adults impacted by the disease. She describes the demographic as an “underserved and underrepresented population” when it comes to cancer.
“There has been a growing awareness” over the last couple of decades amid the increase in cases, she says. But it “depends on where you are. A lot of the larger academic institutions are well versed in AYA needs and challenges and differences. That doesn’t happen as much in the smaller community settings.” And she notes that while there’s “slightly more academic research,” there may still not be “as much clinical research.” 
“I think there’s still a lot of work to be done,” she says.
Researchers stress the importance of further raising awareness about cancer in the age group — among both young people themselves and their doctors — and studying their cases so treatment can be better tailored.
Danielle Carnival, the White House cancer moonshot coordinator, says the administration is “really focused on how to bridge the gap” in cancer care for adolescents and young adults, “both in understanding the science and helping serve those patients better.”
The administration is closely following research into potential causes for the increase in cases and prioritizing “decreasing the impact of preventable cancers,” she says, including by working to further lower smoking rates and by “looking at nutrition and lifestyle.”
Bleyer, of the Knight Cancer Institute, points to lung cancer and melanoma as “examples of how we can do better” at preventing early-onset cancer. Both have beaten against the current in recent years, growing scarcer in the young even as other cancers have become more common. Researchers have linked lung cancer’s drop-off to the decline in smoking, and melanoma’s to the embrace of sun protection.
For now, though, the overall rise in rates shows no sign of stopping. And it may be a canary in a coal mine.
“One of the reasons that we look at trends in younger adults is because it’s the best way to evaluate progress, because that’s where you first see changing patterns in cancer,” says Rebecca Siegel, a cancer epidemiologist and Senior Scientific Director of Surveillance Research at the American Cancer Society.
Several cancer researchers I spoke to agree: The age group now passing through adolescence and young adulthood, who were buffeted by a not yet fully understood cocktail of risk factors in the early years of their lives, will likely continue to suffer higher rates of cancer as they get older. 
It’s already happening, at least for colorectal cancer, Siegel says: Since 2010, advanced cancers of that type have become more common among Americans aged 50-64. 
“The younger people have elevated risk their whole life,” Siegel says. “As they age, they will carry that elevated risk with them.”

vanessa chapoy had just turned 24 when she felt the lump in her breast it was “huge” she remembers “like the size of a walnut or a big marble” she went to the first in a series of doctors that night to have it checked out twoandahalf weeks later she was diagnosed with breast cancer stage two she would learn
“and my whole world flipped upside down” chapoy says


  

she entered a gauntlet of treatments a lumpectomy to cut out the tumor and a portion of surrounding breast tissue fertility treatments so she could freeze her eggs five months of chemotherapy and then a double mastectomy to remove both of her breasts 
three years on she’s still undergoing hormone therapyan experience she likens to “early menopause”and occasionally suffering from “chemo brain” a form of brain fog resulting from chemotherapy that she says makes it more difficult for her to complete tasks or remember certain things
“i don’t understand how this could happen” she recalls telling a nurse at the beginning of it all “i’m so young”



		special report curing cancer	


cancer after all most often strikes late in life in the united states nearly 60 percent of patients are 65 or older when they’re diagnosed
but stories like chapoy’s are becoming more common in recent decades cancer rates have been climbing among people under 50 the typical cutoff for when cancer is considered “earlyonset”

this “earlyonset cancer epidemic” as one recent study published in nature reviews clinical oncology dubbed it comprises a surge in the incidence of over a dozen different cancers in younger people since the 1990s in countries around the world


  

in the us the rate of earlyonset cases rose by almost 18 percent between 2000 and 2019 even as cancer declined slightly in older adults according to data from the national cancer institute nci among americans between 15 and 39 years old an age group cancer researchers refer to as adolescents and young adults ayas the surge was more pronounced still topping 20 percent
that increase has spanned genders races and organs it has stormed through young people’s blood and bone marrow launched assaults on their gastrointestinal tracts quartered itself in their reproductive organs the incidence of breast cancer in americans aged 1539 rose more than 17 percent over the 19year period myeloma rates spiked by over 30 percent colorectal cancer by nearly 45 percent
why cancer researchers aren’t entirely sure


  

the rising rates are “probably partially attributable to increasing uptake of screening and early detection” in certain cancer types especially thyroid cancer and prostate cancer the authors of the nature study noted
archie bleyer a clinical research professor at the knight cancer institute of the oregon health  science university says the surge in cases of thyroid cancer as well as kidney cancer is at least partly a result of “overdiagnosis” due to increased screenings both for cancer and for other health concerns the screenings have detected tumors and masses in those organs that “look like cancer so they’ve got to call it carcinoma” he explains but they “would never have been a problem if they were never picked up” because they typically wouldn’t spread or progress 
so “in some ways it’s a false increase” bleyer says 


  


sign up for the latest from the hill here

the surge in rates goes beyond what can be accounted for by increased screenings however researchers hypothesize a slew of environmental and lifestyle changes since the mid20th century have also driven a real rise in cases by increasing exposure to risk factors early in life
the main suspect researchers point to is obesity which has climbed steadily since the 1960s and become more common in childhood and adolescence many of the cancers rising among younger people have been tied to obesity including breast cancer and uterine cancer as well as colorectal cancer and several others impacting the gastrointestinal tract
the increases in obesityrelated cancers have been more “dramatic” than those among other types suggesting obesity is a “big contributor” to the spike in earlyonset cases says tomotaka ugai an instructor at harvard medical school and brigham and women’s hospital and the lead author of the nature study 


  

beyond obesity itself researchers believe a number of related factors could be involved westernized diets sugarsweetened beverages red and processed meat sedentary lifestyles a decline in physical activity metabolic conditions like type 2 diabetes
and the list of suspects goes on bleyer says the increased use of diagnostic imaging such as ct scans and x rays which expose patients to low levels of carcinogenic radiation could be contributing especially for cancers impacting the blood and bone marrow when it comes to the uptick in testicular cancer meanwhile he says rising cannabis use is likely the leading culprit

people growing taller could also be a risk factor for several cancer types he says ugai tells me there’s speculation changes in our sleep patterns could be involved though evidence is “quite limited” marios giannakis a medical oncologist and researcher at the danafarber gastrointestinal cancer center says changes in the microbiomethe community of microorganisms that populate the bodyhave been “implicated” in the increase in earlyonset colorectal cancer these changes can result from diet lifestyle factors or even surgical procedures such as csections
giannakis stresses that more research is needed to understand what’s behind the rising rates including longterm prospective cohort studies that follow participants over extended periods of time 
“finding out the why could be very relevant for prevention” giannakis says


  

but as research continues more than 85000 american adolescents and young adults are now being diagnosed with cancer each year in 2020 chapoy was one of the unlucky thousands two years later i was 
i went to the dermatologist for the first time in my life in august within twenty minutes of stepping into the exam room i’d had a suspicious mole cut out of my forearm i learned days later that i’d had melanoma the deadliest form of skin cancer i was 27
my cancer was caught early and easily removed a month after i first went to the dermatologist all that remained of it was an inchandahalflong scar and some haunting whatifs but that’s not the case for many adolescent and young adult patients they’re often diagnosed at a more advanced stage when cancer has already had time to grow and spread in the body there are several reasons for that they’re less likely to regularly visit the doctor than other patients they’re more likely to be uninsured and because cancer is relatively rare in the age group it’s usually not top of mind for either doctors or patients as a possible explanation for symptoms 
when chapoy went to urgent care the night she found the lump in her breast she said she was told “it’s nothing to worry about you’re probably ovulating”
“it was a struggle getting the doctors to take me seriously at first” she says “if i had just listened to that first doctor i wouldn’t be here”
despite the often late diagnoses adolescents and young adults are more likely to survive their initial cancer diagnosis than older adults more than 85 percent live to see the fiveyear mark compared to 74 percent of 40 to 64yearolds and fewer than 62 percent of those aged 65 and older
but chun chao a cancer epidemiologist with the kaiser permanente southern california department of research  evaluation emphasizes that “the challenge for cancer survivors doesn’t stop when they complete their treatment” 
cancer can recur or progress and young survivors also face a heightened threat of developing a second cancer or an array of other medical conditions chao says including “cardiovascular diseases metabolic disorders endocrine conditions pulmonary diseases liver disease renal failure and musculoskeletal conditions” in addition to those physical ailments she notes survivors have an increased risk of severe depression or anxiety
and the timing presents a unique set of challenges and disruptions to adolescent and young adult patients that extend beyond their health
“they are at a transitional stage in life” chao says “if you think about it this is the age when people are trying to establish their independence some people are finishing up their education people are trying to get their first job just start to establish their career and people are starting new families and starting to have kids so at this particular age having a cancer diagnosis can be a huge disruption to these goals”
after tatyana ridgeway was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer when she was 26 she stepped away from work as she went through treatment four cycles of chemotherapy and then proton radiation like chapoy she also underwent fertility treatments as chemotherapy can negatively impact fertility and even cause early menopause
the experience “shattered my idea of what parenthood was like it shattered my idea of what your 20s are supposed to look like” she says “my ideas my beliefs of ‘by this age we’re going to start trying for a kid and then by this age we want to be done’ all of those plans fell off the shelf and just broke”
she was able to preserve some embryos but it was costly she says her in vitro fertilization treatments were covered by insurance but she had to take out a loan to cover the cost of cryopreservation 
her other treatments weren’t cheap either each of her four cycles of chemotherapy cost 15000 and her proton radiation altogether cost over 100000 “that’s without insurance” she says 
chao notes that a “high proportion” of young adult survivors report financial hardships related to cancer including “having to borrow money going into debt or even filing for bankruptcy”
ridgeway who is black says she also looked into cold cap therapy which can help reduce hair loss brought on by chemotherapy but she learned no one with her hair texture“textured curly kinky hair”had been included in trials for the therapy and no one her age had been studied either
“there’s a lack of research specific to this age group” says alison silberman the ceo of stupid cancer a nonprofit that advocates for adolescents and young adults impacted by the disease she describes the demographic as an “underserved and underrepresented population” when it comes to cancer
“there has been a growing awareness” over the last couple of decades amid the increase in cases she says but it “depends on where you are a lot of the larger academic institutions are well versed in aya needs and challenges and differences that doesn’t happen as much in the smaller community settings” and she notes that while there’s “slightly more academic research” there may still not be “as much clinical research” 
“i think there’s still a lot of work to be done” she says
researchers stress the importance of further raising awareness about cancer in the age groupamong both young people themselves and their doctorsand studying their cases so treatment can be better tailored
danielle carnival the white house cancer moonshot coordinator says the administration is “really focused on how to bridge the gap” in cancer care for adolescents and young adults “both in understanding the science and helping serve those patients better”
the administration is closely following research into potential causes for the increase in cases and prioritizing “decreasing the impact of preventable cancers” she says including by working to further lower smoking rates and by “looking at nutrition and lifestyle”
bleyer of the knight cancer institute points to lung cancer and melanoma as “examples of how we can do better” at preventing earlyonset cancer both have beaten against the current in recent years growing scarcer in the young even as other cancers have become more common researchers have linked lung cancer’s dropoff to the decline in smoking and melanoma’s to the embrace of sun protection
for now though the overall rise in rates shows no sign of stopping and it may be a canary in a coal mine
“one of the reasons that we look at trends in younger adults is because it’s the best way to evaluate progress because that’s where you first see changing patterns in cancer” says rebecca siegel a cancer epidemiologist and senior scientific director of surveillance research at the american cancer society
several cancer researchers i spoke to agree the age group now passing through adolescence and young adulthood who were buffeted by a not yet fully understood cocktail of risk factors in the early years of their lives will likely continue to suffer higher rates of cancer as they get older 
it’s already happening at least for colorectal cancer siegel says since 2010 advanced cancers of that type have become more common among americans aged 5064 
“the younger people have elevated risk their whole life” siegel says “as they age they will carry that elevated risk with them”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that a loss to Russia could ultimately force the U.S. to choose between the “collapse of NATO” or going to war.
“If Ukraine would lose, if Russia would occupy Ukraine, Russia will continue going towards Baltic countries, Poland, etcetera,” Zelensky said in an interview with NBC News. “And they will start war with one of the NATO countries, and at this moment, the U.S. would have to choose the collapse of NATO or go to war.”


  

The Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all members of NATO, as is Poland. An attack on any member of the alliance is “considered an attack against them all” under the treaty organization’s principle of collective defense.
Zelensky brought up the possibility of NATO involvement in response to the suggestion from some Republican politicians that the U.S. needs to limit its spending on the war in Ukraine.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — a 2024 Republican presidential candidate — previously described the war as a “territorial dispute,” while arguing that the U.S. should not become “further entangled” in the conflict. Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also warned last fall that a Republican majority in the House would not write a “blank check” to Ukraine for aid.
“Is any candidate or senator who thinks it costs too much for the United States to support Ukraine, is he ready to go to war, to fight, to send his kids,” Zelensky said Thursday, adding, “Because anyway, they will have to do this if NATO gets involved.”
“It’s not Ukraine against Russia,” he said. “Russia is fighting against the civilized world.”
The U.S. and its allies have continued to supply Kyiv with increasingly advanced weaponry, as the war against Russia has dragged on for more than a year. Last month, President Biden reversed course on his refusal to discuss F-16 fighter jets, saying the U.S. would support an international coalition to train Ukrainian pilots on the jets.


  

Zelensky, who has long sought fighter jets, said in Thursday’s interview that the drawn-out process of obtaining such advanced military equipment has “prolonged the war.”

“If we are supplied with the machinery that is currently held by our partners, we will win faster,” he added.

“Our heroic people, our troops who are now at the front of the front line, are facing very tough resistance,” he told NBC News. “And you understand why. Because for Russia to lose this campaign to Ukraine, I would say, actually means losing the war.”

ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said thursday that a loss to russia could ultimately force the us to choose between the “collapse of nato” or going to war
“if ukraine would lose if russia would occupy ukraine russia will continue going towards baltic countries poland etcetera” zelensky said in an interview with nbc news “and they will start war with one of the nato countries and at this moment the us would have to choose the collapse of nato or go to war”


  

the baltic states of estonia latvia and lithuania are all members of nato as is poland an attack on any member of the alliance is “considered an attack against them all” under the treaty organization’s principle of collective defense
zelensky brought up the possibility of nato involvement in response to the suggestion from some republican politicians that the us needs to limit its spending on the war in ukraine
florida gov ron desantisa 2024 republican presidential candidatepreviously described the war as a “territorial dispute” while arguing that the us should not become “further entangled” in the conflict speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif also warned last fall that a republican majority in the house would not write a “blank check” to ukraine for aid
“is any candidate or senator who thinks it costs too much for the united states to support ukraine is he ready to go to war to fight to send his kids” zelensky said thursday adding “because anyway they will have to do this if nato gets involved”
“it’s not ukraine against russia” he said “russia is fighting against the civilized world”
the us and its allies have continued to supply kyiv with increasingly advanced weaponry as the war against russia has dragged on for more than a year last month president biden reversed course on his refusal to discuss f16 fighter jets saying the us would support an international coalition to train ukrainian pilots on the jets


  

zelensky who has long sought fighter jets said in thursday’s interview that the drawnout process of obtaining such advanced military equipment has “prolonged the war”

Tensions boiled over at a House hearing Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans faced off over government funding in light of the recent deal President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reached on spending limits. 
The Republican-led House Appropriations Committee voted along party lines Wednesday afternoon to adopt a bill to fund the departments of Agriculture, Rural Development, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).


  

But appropriators adjourned before approving subcommittee allocations after both sides went back and forth over what a bipartisan agreement secured weeks ago that set caps on funding should mean for the appropriations process this year. 
During the hearing, Democrats vented their frustration with Republicans after GOP negotiators announced plans earlier this week to mark up spending bills at a topline level much lower than the agreed-upon caps between Biden and McCarthy.
Republican leaders have insisted the caps represent a “ceiling” for spending that allows for room to go further below, while Democrats say a GOP-backed move to revert funding to fiscal 2022 levels undercuts the budget deal between both sides. 
“You will not pretend that you’re following a deal that over a majority of the majority voted for?” said Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), top Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government.
“Do you think any of us would have made a deal if we thought your [2022] number was the deal? What kind of deal is that? What kind of respect for yourselves is that?” he added.
Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, also bristled over the GOP plan.


  

“My colleagues, these allocations are either an attempt to appease the same reckless faction that would rather have us default than uphold our constitutional duty,” she said, “or they are evidence that the same Republican members who voted for the debt deal no longer support it.”
Leaders on both sides agreed to spending caps for fiscal 2024 as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA). Congress passed the bill earlier this month to raise the debt limit before an early June deadline to prevent a national default, but not without several proposals aimed at curbing spending to buy necessary GOP support. 
However, since the bill’s passage, a growing number of conservatives have come out against the bipartisan plan, with some pushing for Republicans to revert funding back to fiscal 2022 levels — which is estimated to cut current spending levels by more than $100 billion. 


  

Defending the party’s plan Wednesday, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), who heads the subcommittee tasked with crafting the agriculture funding proposal being considered, fired back at Hoyer while discussing the national debt.
“It’s now $31.6 trillion. It will be $32.6 [trillion] rapidly as this Treasury Secretary has to float a trillion dollars in bonds in the next few weeks,” Harris said. “I would suggest to the gentleman from Maryland, that that actually makes a difference in how this committee has to approach things.”
“We are in difficult times now. We can print pretend they’re not. We can pretend we can print all the money in the world,” Harris said. “We can pretend that inflation doesn’t occur when the Federal Reserve puts a trillion dollars on their balance sheet. We can pretend that, but that’s not reality.”


  

Moments after Harris spoke, however, DeLauro again took aim at Republicans, arguing that “domestic investment is not a driver of the debt” and that “revenue was not put on the table at all” after GOP leadership drew red lines around tax increases on any Americans, as Democrats have called for more tax proposals targeting the wealthy.
House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Kay Granger (R-Texas), then said Democrats were “yelling” at Republicans and that she was “very disappointed to be treated this way.”
Other Republicans also shot back at Democrats, including Rep. Michael Cloud (R-Texas), who said to the other side: “If you want to take the high road and speak to some sort of false piety, I suggest that you get your facts straight first.”

“Today we’ve been called cruel. We’ve been called draconian,” Cloud said. “We’ve been told we’re trying to take food out of the mouths of children, we’ve been told by people who don’t know how to define what a woman is that we’re against women, all these different kinds of things, and then we’re supposed to be told to be respectful and honorable in some mad tirade.”
“This is unconscionable. And it’s ridiculous that it’s happening in this committee,” he added.
Appropriators are set to meet again early Thursday and are expected to again consider subcommittee allocations, and further spending legislation.

President Biden on Thursday chided a reporter who asked about allegations of corruption pushed by House Republicans, dismissing the claims as a “dumb question.”
“Why did the Ukraine FBI informant file refer to you as the big guy?” a New York Post reporter asked at the end of an event focused on addressing junk fees.


  

“Why’d you ask such a dumb question?” Biden replied.
The reporter was referencing an FBI record that has been pushed by House Republicans to allege the Biden family was part of a corruption scheme related to a Ukrainian oligarch. Multiple conservative outlets reported in recent days that the record includes notes that an oligarch involved in the alleged scheme referred to Biden as the “big guy” during a conversation.

But White House officials have repeatedly noted that Republican lawmakers have been unable to confirm or verify the corruption allegations against Biden, which the president himself has dismissed as “malarkey.”
“Every time a right wing talking point about this absurd allegation falls apart under even the slightest scrutiny, the far right moves the goal posts,” Ian Sams, a White House spokesman, tweeted Thursday.
“Informant? Disappeared! Audio tapes? Don’t exist! It wasn’t investigated? Actually Trump’s DOJ/FBI did! Now coercion! Crazy,” Sams tweeted.

North Korea launched two ballistic missiles Thursday to protest military drills by South Korea and the United States, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.
North Korea launched the pair of short-range missiles toward the sea Thursday, South Korea said. The missiles traveled about 480 miles from North Korea’s capital region before landing in the sea between Japan and the Korean Peninsula.


  

The launch came hours after South Korea and the U.S. concluded their fifth round of military drills near the border Thursday, a move that the North Korea military called “provocative and irresponsible” ahead of the missile launch.
“Our army strongly denounces the provocative and irresponsible moves of the puppet military authorities escalating the military tension in the region despite its repeated warnings, and warns them solemnly,” a spokesperson for the North Korean Defense Ministry said in a statement published by North Korea state media KCNA.
“Our armed forces will fully counter any form of demonstrative moves and provocation of the enemies,” the statement added. 
The U.S., Japan and South Korea issued a joint statement Thursday condemning the missile launch by North Korea. The national security advisers of the three countries called on all nations to “fully implement” United Nations Security Council resolutions that are meant to prevent North Korea from “acquiring the technologies and materials needed to carry out these destabilizing launches.”
“These launches are clear violations of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, and demonstrate the threat the DPRK’s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs pose to the region, international peace and security, and the global non-proliferation regime,” the advisers wrote in the statement.

This launch comes as national security adviser Jake Sullivan meets Thursday with advisers from South Korea and Japan in Tokyo, where they discussed coordination tactics in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, the White House said.


  

This is the first launch by North Korea since it failed to launch a spy satellite into orbit last month. North Korea announced that its plans to launch the spy satellite was necessary due to the United States’s “reckless” military exercises with South Korea.

It is hurricane season again in the Atlantic. Although it is exceedingly rare, hurricanes — or at least their extratropical remnants resulting in strong winds — have battered the United Kingdom in the past. 
One hurricane of a royal familial sort already struck hard earlier this year in the form of Prince Harry, the duke of Sussex. The ensuing gale force torrents of air produced by Harry were fueled, in part, by the clash of hot Montecito air he exhaled when, in a written statement, the self-exiled son of King Charles III brashly condemned his father’s government in the polar arctic air of a British courtroom in London. 


  

The destructive force of Harry’s words was of a Category 5 nature, at least in terms of the damage they immediately caused — and are causing — to the United Kingdom. 
It is one thing for him to pursue his legal claims, as is his right, against alleged illegal media activity. It is quite another for him to attack His Majesty’s government, declaring it to be “at rock bottom.” 
Harry has, in fact, just breached an inviolate British convention whereby the royal family remains above and apart from the fray of domestic politics. The 38-year-old prince who grew up as the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and served his country in Afghanistan as an Army helicopter pilot apparently missed that block of instruction. 
He clearly has no grasp of the gravity and responsibility of the affairs of state. Or, perchance, if he does, then he clearly does not care how his words and actions, in pursuit of personal goals or vendettas, actively undermine the national well-being and security of the country of his birth. 
This naïveté, if that’s what it is, began with his Oprah Winfrey interview in March 2021. He and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, implied that someone in the royal family was racist — an implication not disowned until 21 months later, when Harry denied it in an interview with ITV’s Tom Bradby in December 2022.
Notwithstanding the damage Harry and Meghan Markle did to the Commonwealth of Nations and the UK’s standing within it by allowing that implied accusation to hang in the air, the troubled duo greatly compounded the harm they had caused by subsequently permitting Afua Hirsch’s derisive description of the 56-member alliance as “Empire 2.0” to be associated with them during the “Harry & Meghan” Netflix series. 


  

As such, perceived royal familial grievances were blindly allowed to turn into an insinuation of a UK malevolently intent on exploiting its Commonwealth partners. 
It is bad enough to play into the hands of Russian and Chinese disinformation in this fashion. But now Harry’s crusade against his family has created a constitutional crisis in the UK. Fortunately, for now, at least from King Charles’s perspective, calmer heads are prevailing. 
Despite being the target of Harry’s courtroom ire and blindsided by it while traveling in the U.S. to meet with President Joe Biden to discuss the war in Ukraine and other vital bilateral matters, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak temporarily defused the situation by saying, “As you know, we have a long-standing convention that prime ministers don’t comment on members of the royal family.”


  

This respite aside, “Hurricane Harry” is still a tropical depression bearing down on King Charles and not going away any time soon. Charles is a monarch, but he is also a father. No doubt he was moved by his youngest son coming close to tears on the witness stand, making his case to the court why his phone and voicemail-hacking claims for monetary damages should be allowed to proceed against Mirror Group Newspapers. 
But by breaking royal protocol and attacking his own father’s elected government, Harry is undermining the sacrosanct equivalent of a U.S. separation of powers, wherein the royal family does not involve itself in the workings of His Majesty’s government. This understood separation of powers is the bedrock of the relationship not only between king and parliament, but between king and country as well. 
Harry’s hurricane-force shenanigans risk badly destabilizing the constitutional monarchy if not jeopardizing its very survival. As it is, public support for the British monarchy is at an all-time low, according to a poll by the National Center for Social Research. The survey found “45% of respondents said either it should be abolished, was not at all important, or not very important.” Alarmingly for British royalists, only “12% of 18-to-34-year-olds view the monarchy as “very important.


  

While it is ultimately up to the British to decide their form of government — and as Americans, we should take no position — it is clear that the added damage Hurricane Harry is creating could not come at a worse time. Europe — indeed, all of the West, including the U.S. — is in an existential fight in Ukraine and potentially soon in Taiwan, wherein either liberal democracy or the Russian and Chinese form of autocracy will conquer all. Harry, accordingly, must rise above being the man and the son he has been thus far on the world stage.
Now is not the time for a recalcitrant prince crassly conflating fleeting Hollywood celebrity with statesmanship. This critical moment in global history calls for some level of gravity. It is not the moment for exaggerated paparazzi taxi chase stunts, high school-like social drama over Harry’s attendance at his father’s coronation and the “worldwide privacy tour” by Harry and Meghan, memorably lampooned by South Park.

		How Trump ended up with Judge Cannon 	

Rather, it is high time Harry recognizes that he can no longer keep placing his father, and by extension the United Kingdom and the U.S., in the eye of his storm. The hurricane-like damage to national security is becoming too great and potentially irreparable. 


  

Hurricanes eventually run their course. Harry’s has gone on long enough.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announced plans to file articles of impeachment against President Biden on Thursday, alleging he has violated his oath of office in not securing the country’s borders and protecting national security. 
Greene said at a press conference this will be the “first set” of articles she introduces against Biden, whom she said has purposefully failed to fulfill his responsibilities of the presidency.


  

“It is with the highest amount of solemnity that I announce my intention to introduce articles of impeachment today on the head of this America-last executive branch, that has been working since Jan. 20, 2021, to systematically destroy this country, the president of the United States, Joseph Robinette Biden,” Greene said.
Greene made a similar announcement two days ago regarding her plans to introduce articles of impeachment against FBI Director Christopher Wray and Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

Greene said she has also introduced articles of impeachment against Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
The White House called Greene’s plan a “stunt,” noting Biden is focused on “preventing House Republicans’ default that would crash the economy.”
“Is there a bigger example of a shameless sideshow political stunt than a trolling impeachment attack by one of the most extreme MAGA members in Congress over ‘national security’ while she actively demands to defund the FBI and even said she ‘would’ve been armed’ and ‘would have won’ the January 6 insurrection, if only she’d been in charge of it?” said Ian Sams, White House spokesman for oversight and investigations.


  

Greene initially introduced articles of impeachment against Biden on the first day of his presidency. She also filed articles against Garland in August following the search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property for the classified and sensitive documents taken there. Neither advanced in the House.

The Georgia Republican and ally of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Biden has refused to enforced immigration laws and secure the border, “deliberately” compromising U.S. national security. She said he has allowed migrants to “invade” the country while depriving border control agents of the resources and policies they need to perform their duties.
Greene said Biden has allowed fentanyl to “flood” into the country and kill Americans every day.


  

She also slammed the administration over its plan to direct Customs and Border Protection to release migrants into the U.S. without a set court date or way to track them. Under the plan, migrants need to check in with an app until they are given a court date to appear.
Greene said it amounts to “catch-and-release,” allowing the migrants to be released instead of being held in custody until their court date.
“His policies, directives and statements surrounding the southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country,” she said. “Biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty, and he is a direct threat to our national security.”

Article II of the Constitution states that the president and other U.S. officials can be removed from office through impeachment and conviction on “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”
Greene said she wants to take time to gather cosponsors on her impeachment resolutions. She avoided directly answering a question on what exact charges she would file against Biden.


  

She said she discussed her plans to file the impeachment articles with other members of Republican leadership and said they did not ask her not to move forward.
She said she is introducing the articles because a majority the “base” of Republican voters and other Americans outside it agree with impeaching these officials, describing it as “the right thing to do.”
“There’s never any consequences for anyone in the federal government when regular American citizens face consequences all the time, and I’m introducing these articles because this is what people are demanding,” Greene said.


  




		Latest border figures show 56 percent drop in encounters following lift of Title 42	


Mayorkas has faced intense criticism from many Republicans over the situation at the southern border, which experienced a record number of migrant crossings in recent months. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) called for Mayorkas’s impeachment last week.
Greene alleges Wray and Garland have turned the FBI and Justice Department into Biden’s “personal police force” to prosecute the administration’s political opponents. She claimed that those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection were mostly peaceful, but Garland has still pursued them. A bipartisan Senate report found last year that seven people died related to the attack on the Capitol that day.
Greene said Wray prioritizes his own party above performing his job, wrongly identifying the Republican Wray as a Democrat. He has been director of the FBI since August 2017 and was nominated by former President Trump.


  

She said she is filing impeachment articles against Graves, the U.S. attorney, over his prosecutions of Jan. 6 defendants, which she said have continued while he has declined to prosecute 67 percent of people arrested by Washington, D.C., police last year.
“That affects people in our nation’s capital, just regular innocent people that live and work here. I think as our conference learns more and more on this, they’ll understand it,” she said.
Greene said employees are fired from their jobs if they are corrupt or are not adequately serving their employers. She said all five officials are corrupt and unfit to hold office, so they must be impeached.

rep marjorie taylor greene rga announced plans to file articles of impeachment against president biden on thursday alleging he has violated his oath of office in not securing the country’s borders and protecting national security 
greene said at a press conference this will be the “first set” of articles she introduces against biden whom she said has purposefully failed to fulfill his responsibilities of the presidency


  

“it is with the highest amount of solemnity that i announce my intention to introduce articles of impeachment today on the head of this americalast executive branch that has been working since jan 20 2021 to systematically destroy this country the president of the united states joseph robinette biden” greene said
greene made a similar announcement two days ago regarding her plans to introduce articles of impeachment against fbi director christopher wray and matthew graves the us attorney for the district of columbia

rep marjorie taylor greene rga listens to testimony during the house oversight and accountability committee hearing entitled “overdue oversight of the capital city part ii” at the capitol on tuesday may 16th 2023 tierney l cross
greene said she has also introduced articles of impeachment against attorney general merrick garland and secretary of homeland security alejandro mayorkas
the white house called greene’s plan a “stunt” noting biden is focused on “preventing house republicans’ default that would crash the economy”
“is there a bigger example of a shameless sideshow political stunt than a trolling impeachment attack by one of the most extreme maga members in congress over ‘national security’ while she actively demands to defund the fbi and even said she ‘would’ve been armed’ and ‘would have won’ the january 6 insurrection if only she’d been in charge of it” said ian sams white house spokesman for oversight and investigations


  

greene initially introduced articles of impeachment against biden on the first day of his presidency she also filed articles against garland in august following the search of former president trump’s maralago property for the classified and sensitive documents taken there neither advanced in the house

the georgia republican and ally of house speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif said biden has refused to enforced immigration laws and secure the border “deliberately” compromising us national security she said he has allowed migrants to “invade” the country while depriving border control agents of the resources and policies they need to perform their duties
greene said biden has allowed fentanyl to “flood” into the country and kill americans every day


  

she also slammed the administration over its plan to direct customs and border protection to release migrants into the us without a set court date or way to track them under the plan migrants need to check in with an app until they are given a court date to appear
greene said it amounts to “catchandrelease” allowing the migrants to be released instead of being held in custody until their court date
“his policies directives and statements surrounding the southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country” she said “biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty and he is a direct threat to our national security”


  


president joe biden gestures as he boards air force one at andrews air force base md wednesday may 17 2023 as he heads to hiroshima japan to attend the g7 ap photojess rapfogel
article ii of the constitution states that the president and other us officials can be removed from office through impeachment and conviction on “treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors”
greene said she wants to take time to gather cosponsors on her impeachment resolutions she avoided directly answering a question on what exact charges she would file against biden


  

she said she discussed her plans to file the impeachment articles with other members of republican leadership and said they did not ask her not to move forward
she said she is introducing the articles because a majority the “base” of republican voters and other americans outside it agree with impeaching these officials describing it as “the right thing to do”
“there’s never any consequences for anyone in the federal government when regular american citizens face consequences all the time and i’m introducing these articles because this is what people are demanding” greene said


  




		latest border figures show 56 percent drop in encounters following lift of title 42	


mayorkas has faced intense criticism from many republicans over the situation at the southern border which experienced a record number of migrant crossings in recent months house majority whip tom emmer rminn called for mayorkas’s impeachment last week
greene alleges wray and garland have turned the fbi and justice department into biden’s “personal police force” to prosecute the administration’s political opponents she claimed that those who participated in the jan 6 2021 insurrection were mostly peaceful but garland has still pursued them a bipartisan senate report found last year that seven people died related to the attack on the capitol that day
greene said wray prioritizes his own party above performing his job wrongly identifying the republican wray as a democrat he has been director of the fbi since august 2017 and was nominated by former president trump


  

she said she is filing impeachment articles against graves the us attorney over his prosecutions of jan 6 defendants which she said have continued while he has declined to prosecute 67 percent of people arrested by washington dc police last year
“that affects people in our nation’s capital just regular innocent people that live and work here i think as our conference learns more and more on this they’ll understand it” she said
greene said employees are fired from their jobs if they are corrupt or are not adequately serving their employers she said all five officials are corrupt and unfit to hold office so they must be impeached

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced legislation Thursday that will reimpose a ban on U.S. fossil fuel exports, citing environmental hazards and possible impacts on domestic prices.
The measure would “help prioritize American consumers, protect our climate and promote environmental justice and put the United States on a path to self-sufficiency through domestic clean energy production,” Markey said Thursday at a press conference on Capitol Hill, flanked by supporters of the bill from communities in the Rio Grande Valley and the Gulf Coast.


  

Markey disputed the idea that the ban would result in higher prices for American consumers, pointing to International Energy Agency data indicating that increased U.S. exports were accompanied by higher domestic prices for natural gas.
“So ordinary families have to pay more on their natural gas bill, because the big oil and gas companies want to sell it overseas, but that leaves less here, which drives up the price for natural gas for people who are trying to heat their homes,” he said.
Then-President Obama signed a bill in 2015 lifting a four-decade restriction on U.S. oil exports. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last February, U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in particular have surged as European nations end their imports of Russian oil.
Reps. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) and Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.) introduced corresponding legislation in the House. The bill is likely doomed in the GOP-majority House, but it marks the latest collaboration between Markey and climate-focused House Democrats aimed at promoting aggressive climate action.

John Beard Jr., CEO of the Port Arthur Community Action Network, pointed to a 2022 fire at an LNG export terminal in Port Arthur, Texas, closing it for several weeks.
“In the course of that fire and explosion, in a matter of hours, the price of natural gas dipped in this country by 25 percent in a matter of hours,” Beard, a participant in the press conference, told The Hill. “Why? Because that gas was no longer being exported. By exporting it, you’re putting it on a worldwide market that is considerably higher than what we pay here domestically.”


  

Markey introduced similar legislation in 2021, about 10 months before the Russian invasion, which led to record U.S. LNG exports in March.

With the White House and House leadership less than two weeks away from a default deadline on the country’s debt, anxiety is rising over the potential impact on federal programs such as Medicaid and the beneficiaries who depend on it.
Among the sticking points is Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) push for work requirements to be added to federal assistance programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.


  

McCarthy told reporters before a meeting with President Biden on Tuesday that adding work requirements was a “red line” for him, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has called the proposal a “nonstarter.”
Health care policy experts say a default would be a disaster for the federal programs, though some think the government could stave off the impact on beneficiaries for some time beyond the June 1 “X date” for raising the debt ceiling.

LAST WEEK: Takeaways from initial White House debt ceiling meeting


If a default does occur, the federal government will likely prioritize paying bond holders in order to avoid a technical default. It remains unclear where Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security would fall on the list of priorities — policy experts aren’t even sure the Treasury Department has the capacity to prioritize payments in a specific order.
“Social Security and Medicare are major sources of federal expenditure, and in most scenarios, they will be impacted,” said Katherine Hempstead, senior policy advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “Medicare is the financial backbone of our healthcare system, so the consequences to hospitals and health care providers will be profound.”
The U.S. has never in history defaulted on its debt, and there is no precedent for payments to federal health programs being delayed.
“Even approaching default could damage the economy, as we saw in 2011,” a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) spokesperson told The Hill.


  

The debt ceiling standoff in 2011 resulted in the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling, stock prices plummeting and the country’s credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history. There are fears this fight could be even worse.
“While the precise impact on CMS’s programs depends on many uncertain factors, it is clear that if the federal government is prevented from making good on its promises, there would be significant consequences for Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces,” CMS added.
In traditional Medicare, CMS reimburses providers directly for services. In the absence of available funding, providers would have to prepare for reimbursements to stop coming in, but there may be some cushion before that happens.


  

The sluggish rate at which Medicare bills are paid could help providers in the wake of a default, according to Joseph Antos, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
“For at least a month, maybe two months, hospitals and doctors offices and other providers would continue to get payments from the Medicare program, but for services that they provided potentially months ago,” Antos said.
And a 1996 amendment to the Social Security Act could provide temporary relief if the default were to persist for some months. The law states that federal trust funds cannot be cashed out for any purpose except for the “payment of benefits,” such as Social Security and Medicare. The most recent report from the Social Security Administration stated the trust has $2.83 trillion in reserves.


  

“Theoretically, the Treasury Department could release very substantial sums of money, which would then have to be used to pay federal bills,” Antos said. “That includes Medicare payments to medical providers. It also includes Social Security but it also includes payments to defense contracts and the janitor at the [Department of Health and Human Services] building. Basically all of those would be paid, kind of in the order as they come in.”
In Antos’s estimate, if a default did come to pass, it would only be a matter of weeks before lawmakers were cowed into reaching a deal, and he believes federal health programs can survive for a few weeks.
Still, others feel that the urgency of the situation isn’t quite hitting home for those on Capitol Hill.


  

“The situation this year seems more serious in that, you know, one side of the discussion — namely the House Republicans — seem to be less worried about the prospect of default than they should be,” said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former staffer at the Congressional Budget Office.

“McCarthy has said that he doesn’t want the government to default, that he recognizes the serious adverse impacts that would have, but it’s not clear that all of the Republican caucus feels the same way.”
McCarthy has said that House Republicans already passed their debt limit package, and it’s up to the Biden administration to respond. He emerged from Tuesday’s talks saying that the “structure” of the talks had improved. 


  

But he added, “I’m not more optimistic. You’re only 15 days away, and you’re trying to raise the debt ceiling.”

with the white house and house leadership less than two weeks away from a default deadline on the country’s debt anxiety is rising over the potential impact on federal programs such as medicaid and the beneficiaries who depend on it
among the sticking points is speaker kevin mccarthy’s rcalif push for work requirements to be added to federal assistance programs such as medicaid and the supplemental nutrition assistance program


  

mccarthy told reporters before a meeting with president biden on tuesday that adding work requirements was a “red line” for him while house minority leader hakeem jeffries dny has called the proposal a “nonstarter”
health care policy experts say a default would be a disaster for the federal programs though some think the government could stave off the impact on beneficiaries for some time beyond the june 1 “x date” for raising the debt ceiling

if a default does occur the federal government will likely prioritize paying bond holders in order to avoid a technical default it remains unclear where medicare medicaid and social security would fall on the list of prioritiespolicy experts aren’t even sure the treasury department has the capacity to prioritize payments in a specific order
“social security and medicare are major sources of federal expenditure and in most scenarios they will be impacted” said katherine hempstead senior policy advisor at the robert wood johnson foundation “medicare is the financial backbone of our healthcare system so the consequences to hospitals and health care providers will be profound”
the us has never in history defaulted on its debt and there is no precedent for payments to federal health programs being delayed
“even approaching default could damage the economy as we saw in 2011” a centers for medicare  medicaid services cms spokesperson told the hill


  

the debt ceiling standoff in 2011 resulted in the us reaching the debt ceiling stock prices plummeting and the country’s credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history there are fears this fight could be even worse
“while the precise impact on cms’s programs depends on many uncertain factors it is clear that if the federal government is prevented from making good on its promises there would be significant consequences for medicaid medicare and the affordable care act marketplaces” cms added
in traditional medicare cms reimburses providers directly for services in the absence of available funding providers would have to prepare for reimbursements to stop coming in but there may be some cushion before that happens


  

the sluggish rate at which medicare bills are paid could help providers in the wake of a default according to joseph antos senior fellow at the american enterprise institute
“for at least a month maybe two months hospitals and doctors offices and other providers would continue to get payments from the medicare program but for services that they provided potentially months ago” antos said
and a 1996 amendment to the social security act could provide temporary relief if the default were to persist for some months the law states that federal trust funds cannot be cashed out for any purpose except for the “payment of benefits” such as social security and medicare the most recent report from the social security administration stated the trust has 283 trillion in reserves


  

“theoretically the treasury department could release very substantial sums of money which would then have to be used to pay federal bills” antos said “that includes medicare payments to medical providers it also includes social security but it also includes payments to defense contracts and the janitor at the department of health and human services building basically all of those would be paid kind of in the order as they come in”
in antos’s estimate if a default did come to pass it would only be a matter of weeks before lawmakers were cowed into reaching a deal and he believes federal health programs can survive for a few weeks
still others feel that the urgency of the situation isn’t quite hitting home for those on capitol hill


  

“the situation this year seems more serious in that you know one side of the discussionnamely the house republicans — seem to be less worried about the prospect of default than they should be” said paul van de water a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and a former staffer at the congressional budget office

“mccarthy has said that he doesn’t want the government to default that he recognizes the serious adverse impacts that would have but it’s not clear that all of the republican caucus feels the same way”
mccarthy has said that house republicans already passed their debt limit package and it’s up to the biden administration to respond he emerged from tuesday’s talks saying that the “structure” of the talks had improved 


  

but he added “i’m not more optimistic you’re only 15 days away and you’re trying to raise the debt ceiling”

Vice President Harris on Thursday convened a call of elected officials, local leaders and administration allies to warn of the dangers of a potential default as she takes on an increased role in the White House’s messaging on the debt ceiling.
Harris led a virtual briefing on the debt ceiling fight, where she underscored the White House’s position that Congress should lift the debt ceiling and urged local leaders on the call to inform their constituents of the possible consequences of inaction.


  

“Our position is clear and simple: Congress must act to prevent a default,” Harris said on the briefing, which was open to members of the media.
“We just need you, the leaders on this call, to do what you always do and make sure your voices are heard,” Harris added. “Make sure members of Congress know a default would not be acceptable under any circumstances. Let’s organize, activate our communities, and remind folks of what’s at stake and get the word about why this issue is so important.”
Thursday’s virtual briefing took place while President Biden is in Japan for the Group of Seven Summit through Sunday. It was the latest sign that Harris is taking on a larger role as the White House pushes Congress to raise the debt ceiling and seeks to warn the public about the fallout if lawmakers do not act.
Harris joined Biden and the top four congressional leaders in the Oval Office for a meeting Tuesday about the debt ceiling and budget negotiations. The White House and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have since appointed lead negotiators to try and hammer out an agreement in the coming days.
“While Joe Biden has left the country, border czar Kamala Harris is now involved in debt ceiling negotiations despite presiding over the worst border crisis in history,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement Thursday. “The Biden-Harris administration’s lack of leadership creates crisis after crisis, leaving American families to suffer the consequences, but they don’t care.”
The Treasury Department has warned the U.S. could default by early June if Congress does not act to raise the debt ceiling, which covers spending already approved by lawmakers.


  

Harris on Thursday warned a default, or even getting close to it, could raise borrowing rates, hurt retirement accounts by triggering a stock market downturn and risk sending the economy into a recession.
The vice president was joined on Thursday’s call by Lael Brainard, the head of the National Economic Council, and Steve Benjamin, who leads the White House Office of Public Engagement. 
Brainard told those on the call that negotiators are working toward a “reasonable bipartisan budget agreement, which we do every year.”


  

White House negotiations have been instructed to push back on any attempts to reverse Biden administration policies to combat climate change and lower drug costs and other expenses for middle class families, as well as any efforts to take away health care.
“The last thing American families need is a manufactured crisis that would destabilize the hard won progress we’ve seen for no reason,” Brainard said.

The White House has for months maintained Congress has a responsibility to raise the debt ceiling without conditions, pointing to the dozens of times lawmakers have done so in the past. But in recent days as negotiations have intensified, administration officials have signaled they are simultaneously willing to push for a debt limit increase and negotiate a budget agreement with Republicans who are looking for ways to slash government spending.


  

Designated negotiators for the White House and the Speaker are set to meet through this week, and the president and congressional leaders are expected to reconvene next week when Biden has returned from Japan.
The president scrapped plans to visit Australia and Papua New Guinea next week in order to return for budget talks.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announced plans to file articles of impeachment against President Biden on Thursday, alleging he has violated his oath of office in not securing the country’s borders and protecting national security. 
Greene said at a press conference this will be the “first set” of articles she introduces against Biden, whom she said has purposefully failed to fulfill his responsibilities of the presidency.


  

“It is with the highest amount of solemnity that I announce my intention to introduce articles of impeachment today on the head of this America-last executive branch, that has been working since Jan. 20, 2021, to systematically destroy this country, the president of the United States, Joseph Robinette Biden,” Greene said.
Greene made a similar announcement two days ago regarding her plans to introduce articles of impeachment against FBI Director Christopher Wray and Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

Greene said she has also introduced articles of impeachment against Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
The White House called Greene’s plan a “stunt,” noting Biden is focused on “preventing House Republicans’ default that would crash the economy.”
“Is there a bigger example of a shameless sideshow political stunt than a trolling impeachment attack by one of the most extreme MAGA members in Congress over ‘national security’ while she actively demands to defund the FBI and even said she ‘would’ve been armed’ and ‘would have won’ the January 6 insurrection, if only she’d been in charge of it?” said Ian Sams, White House spokesman for oversight and investigations.


  

Greene initially introduced articles of impeachment against Biden on the first day of his presidency. She also filed articles against Garland in August following the search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property for the classified and sensitive documents taken there. Neither advanced in the House.

The Georgia Republican and ally of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Biden has refused to enforced immigration laws and secure the border, “deliberately” compromising U.S. national security. She said he has allowed migrants to “invade” the country while depriving border control agents of the resources and policies they need to perform their duties.
Greene said Biden has allowed fentanyl to “flood” into the country and kill Americans every day.


  

She also slammed the administration over its plan to direct Customs and Border Protection to release migrants into the U.S. without a set court date or way to track them. Under the plan, migrants need to check in with an app until they are given a court date to appear.
Greene said it amounts to “catch-and-release,” allowing the migrants to be released instead of being held in custody until their court date.
“His policies, directives and statements surrounding the southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country,” she said. “Biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty, and he is a direct threat to our national security.”

Article II of the Constitution states that the president and other U.S. officials can be removed from office through impeachment and conviction on “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”
Greene said she wants to take time to gather cosponsors on her impeachment resolutions. She avoided directly answering a question on what exact charges she would file against Biden.


  

She said she discussed her plans to file the impeachment articles with other members of Republican leadership and said they did not ask her not to move forward.
She said she is introducing the articles because a majority the “base” of Republican voters and other Americans outside it agree with impeaching these officials, describing it as “the right thing to do.”
“There’s never any consequences for anyone in the federal government when regular American citizens face consequences all the time, and I’m introducing these articles because this is what people are demanding,” Greene said.

Mayorkas has faced intense criticism from many Republicans over the situation at the southern border, which experienced a record number of migrant crossings in recent months. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) called for Mayorkas’s impeachment last week.
Greene alleges Wray and Garland have turned the FBI and Justice Department into Biden’s “personal police force” to prosecute the administration’s political opponents. She claimed that those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection were mostly peaceful, but Garland has still pursued them. A bipartisan Senate report found last year that seven people died related to the attack on the Capitol that day.
Greene said Wray prioritizes his own party above performing his job, wrongly identifying the Republican Wray as a Democrat. He has been director of the FBI since August 2017 and was nominated by former President Trump.


  

She said she is filing impeachment articles against Graves, the U.S. attorney, over his prosecutions of Jan. 6 defendants, which she said have continued while he has declined to prosecute 67 percent of people arrested by Washington, D.C., police last year.
“That affects people in our nation’s capital, just regular innocent people that live and work here. I think as our conference learns more and more on this, they’ll understand it,” she said.
Greene said employees are fired from their jobs if they are corrupt or are not adequately serving their employers. She said all five officials are corrupt and unfit to hold office, so they must be impeached.

rep marjorie taylor greene rga announced plans to file articles of impeachment against president biden on thursday alleging he has violated his oath of office in not securing the country’s borders and protecting national security 
greene said at a press conference this will be the “first set” of articles she introduces against biden whom she said has purposefully failed to fulfill his responsibilities of the presidency


  

“it is with the highest amount of solemnity that i announce my intention to introduce articles of impeachment today on the head of this americalast executive branch that has been working since jan 20 2021 to systematically destroy this country the president of the united states joseph robinette biden” greene said
greene made a similar announcement two days ago regarding her plans to introduce articles of impeachment against fbi director christopher wray and matthew graves the us attorney for the district of columbia

rep marjorie taylor greene rga listens to testimony during the house oversight and accountability committee hearing entitled “overdue oversight of the capital city part ii” at the capitol on tuesday may 16th 2023 tierney l cross
greene said she has also introduced articles of impeachment against attorney general merrick garland and secretary of homeland security alejandro mayorkas
the white house called greene’s plan a “stunt” noting biden is focused on “preventing house republicans’ default that would crash the economy”
“is there a bigger example of a shameless sideshow political stunt than a trolling impeachment attack by one of the most extreme maga members in congress over ‘national security’ while she actively demands to defund the fbi and even said she ‘would’ve been armed’ and ‘would have won’ the january 6 insurrection if only she’d been in charge of it” said ian sams white house spokesman for oversight and investigations


  

greene initially introduced articles of impeachment against biden on the first day of his presidency she also filed articles against garland in august following the search of former president trump’s maralago property for the classified and sensitive documents taken there neither advanced in the house

the georgia republican and ally of house speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif said biden has refused to enforced immigration laws and secure the border “deliberately” compromising us national security she said he has allowed migrants to “invade” the country while depriving border control agents of the resources and policies they need to perform their duties
greene said biden has allowed fentanyl to “flood” into the country and kill americans every day


  

she also slammed the administration over its plan to direct customs and border protection to release migrants into the us without a set court date or way to track them under the plan migrants need to check in with an app until they are given a court date to appear
greene said it amounts to “catchandrelease” allowing the migrants to be released instead of being held in custody until their court date
“his policies directives and statements surrounding the southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country” she said “biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty and he is a direct threat to our national security”

greene said she wants to take time to gather cosponsors on her impeachment resolutions she avoided directly answering a question on what exact charges she would file against biden


  

she said she discussed her plans to file the impeachment articles with other members of republican leadership and said they did not ask her not to move forward
she said she is introducing the articles because a majority the “base” of republican voters and other americans outside it agree with impeaching these officials describing it as “the right thing to do”
“there’s never any consequences for anyone in the federal government when regular american citizens face consequences all the time and i’m introducing these articles because this is what people are demanding” greene said

mayorkas has faced intense criticism from many republicans over the situation at the southern border which experienced a record number of migrant crossings in recent months house majority whip tom emmer rminn called for mayorkas’s impeachment last week
greene alleges wray and garland have turned the fbi and justice department into biden’s “personal police force” to prosecute the administration’s political opponents she claimed that those who participated in the jan 6 2021 insurrection were mostly peaceful but garland has still pursued them a bipartisan senate report found last year that seven people died related to the attack on the capitol that day
greene said wray prioritizes his own party above performing his job wrongly identifying the republican wray as a democrat he has been director of the fbi since august 2017 and was nominated by former president trump


  

she said she is filing impeachment articles against graves the us attorney over his prosecutions of jan 6 defendants which she said have continued while he has declined to prosecute 67 percent of people arrested by washington dc police last year
“that affects people in our nation’s capital just regular innocent people that live and work here i think as our conference learns more and more on this they’ll understand it” she said
greene said employees are fired from their jobs if they are corrupt or are not adequately serving their employers she said all five officials are corrupt and unfit to hold office so they must be impeached

House conservatives have launched an 11th-hour effort to include tougher border security measures as part of the emerging package to prevent a government default. 
In a letter to the bipartisan leaders negotiating a debt limit compromise, the Republican Study Committee (RSC) argued the migrant influx at the Southern border is — like the threat of default — a crisis facing the country. The group is pushing to attach the GOP’s House-passed border bill to any deal that lifts the government’s borrowing cap.


  

“The security of our border is inextricably linked to the fiscal security of our nation,” the group, led by Reps. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.) and Ben Cline (R-Va.), wrote to President Biden, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and the other leaders navigating the talks.
The proposal is dead on arrival with Democrats in the White House and Congress, but by highlighting the border crisis, it calls attention to an issue that resonates with conservative voters and puts Biden on the defensive.
“The present border crisis may go down as the most preventable debacle in our nation’s history,” the RSC letter reads.
The conservative group says H.R. 2, which Republicans passed through the House last week, “should logically serve as the starting point for considering sound border security measures.”
That package would hike funding for border security agents, promote new construction of the border wall, and put new limits on those migrants seeking asylum, including a restoration of the policy requiring applicants to remain in Mexico during processing. 
That vote followed closely on the heels of the House passage of the Republicans’ debt limit package, which combined an extension of the government’s borrowing authority with steep spending cuts. 


  

A number of conservatives have warned they won’t accept a debt limit package that waters down the deficit spending cuts, which Biden has rejected. The border security piece is being viewed as a way to win the support of those conservatives, even if the cuts are scaled back, as expected. 
“If Biden won’t accept A, then we’ll add the border security bill to it and offer him B,” said Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.). “There’s a lot of folks here that want to do that.”
Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), another Freedom Caucus member, delivered a similar message. 


  

“The only question now, after the House spent 90 days negotiating the [debt limit] increase, is what should be added to it? Which should be the border bill?” he said.
McCarthy this week did not rule out the possibility of pushing for border security as a part of the deal. But he acknowledged the practical limitations of that strategy, which would never get by Democrats. 
“The president, I told him early on, if you find some other policies that we can put in to make the countries safer, make it stronger, I’m more than willing to talk about that,” McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol. “I’m just not sure in the Senate, they have the capacity.”


  

The debt ceiling debate is not the only chance conservatives will have to push for tougher border security. With government funding set to expire Oct. 1, Republicans are already eyeing another shot at attaching the immigration bill to must-pass legislation. 
“The price is going up by the day,” said Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), lead sponsor of the GOP’s border bill. “The border’s on fire, so … I certainly can’t imagine getting through Sept. 30 and not getting border security as part of a package.”
Not everyone, however, is on board.

Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), who had voted against the GOP’s initial debt ceiling package, is warning the push to add border security to the mix serves little purpose — and risks alienating voters wary of Congress’s ability to prevent a default. 
“We’re in our little bubble up here, and the American public just doesn’t get that. They don’t understand why we just don’t get together and figure something out, and that’s not figuring anything out,” Burchett said. 
“It’s just stupid,” he added. “You’ve got two wins, and you’re gonna combine the bills, send them over there and force them to do something? They’re not gonna do anything. Nobody cares, and it’s ridiculous.”

With the White House and House leadership less than two weeks away from a default deadline on the country’s debt, anxiety is rising over the potential impact on federal programs such as Medicaid and the beneficiaries who depend on it.
Among the sticking points is Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) push for work requirements to be added to federal assistance programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.


  

McCarthy told reporters before a meeting with President Biden on Tuesday that adding work requirements was a “red line” for him, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has called the proposal a “nonstarter.”
Health care policy experts say a default would be a disaster for the federal programs, though some think the government could stave off the impact on beneficiaries for some time beyond the June 1 “X date” for raising the debt ceiling.

LAST WEEK: Takeaways from initial White House debt ceiling meeting


If a default does occur, the federal government will likely prioritize paying bond holders in order to avoid a technical default. It remains unclear where Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security would fall on the list of priorities — policy experts aren’t even sure the Treasury Department has the capacity to prioritize payments in a specific order.
“Social Security and Medicare are major sources of federal expenditure, and in most scenarios, they will be impacted,” said Katherine Hempstead, senior policy advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “Medicare is the financial backbone of our healthcare system, so the consequences to hospitals and health care providers will be profound.”
The U.S. has never in history defaulted on its debt, and there is no precedent for payments to federal health programs being delayed.
“Even approaching default could damage the economy, as we saw in 2011,” a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) spokesperson told The Hill.


  

The debt ceiling standoff in 2011 resulted in the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling, stock prices plummeting and the country’s credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history. There are fears this fight could be even worse.
“While the precise impact on CMS’s programs depends on many uncertain factors, it is clear that if the federal government is prevented from making good on its promises, there would be significant consequences for Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces,” CMS added.
In traditional Medicare, CMS reimburses providers directly for services. In the absence of available funding, providers would have to prepare for reimbursements to stop coming in, but there may be some cushion before that happens.


  

The sluggish rate at which Medicare bills are paid could help providers in the wake of a default, according to Joseph Antos, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
“For at least a month, maybe two months, hospitals and doctors offices and other providers would continue to get payments from the Medicare program, but for services that they provided potentially months ago,” Antos said.
And a 1996 amendment to the Social Security Act could provide temporary relief if the default were to persist for some months. The law states that federal trust funds cannot be cashed out for any purpose except for the “payment of benefits,” such as Social Security and Medicare. The most recent report from the Social Security Administration stated the trust has $2.83 trillion in reserves.


  

“Theoretically, the Treasury Department could release very substantial sums of money, which would then have to be used to pay federal bills,” Antos said. “That includes Medicare payments to medical providers. It also includes Social Security but it also includes payments to defense contracts and the janitor at the [Department of Health and Human Services] building. Basically all of those would be paid, kind of in the order as they come in.”
In Antos’s estimate, if a default did come to pass, it would only be a matter of weeks before lawmakers were cowed into reaching a deal, and he believes federal health programs can survive for a few weeks.
Still, others feel that the urgency of the situation isn’t quite hitting home for those on Capitol Hill.


  

“The situation this year seems more serious in that, you know, one side of the discussion — namely the House Republicans — seem to be less worried about the prospect of default than they should be,” said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former staffer at the Congressional Budget Office.

“McCarthy has said that he doesn’t want the government to default, that he recognizes the serious adverse impacts that would have, but it’s not clear that all of the Republican caucus feels the same way.”
McCarthy has said that House Republicans already passed their debt limit package, and it’s up to the Biden administration to respond. He emerged from Tuesday’s talks saying that the “structure” of the talks had improved. 


  

But he added, “I’m not more optimistic. You’re only 15 days away, and you’re trying to raise the debt ceiling.”

with the white house and house leadership less than two weeks away from a default deadline on the country’s debt anxiety is rising over the potential impact on federal programs such as medicaid and the beneficiaries who depend on it
among the sticking points is speaker kevin mccarthy’s rcalif push for work requirements to be added to federal assistance programs such as medicaid and the supplemental nutrition assistance program


  

mccarthy told reporters before a meeting with president biden on tuesday that adding work requirements was a “red line” for him while house minority leader hakeem jeffries dny has called the proposal a “nonstarter”
health care policy experts say a default would be a disaster for the federal programs though some think the government could stave off the impact on beneficiaries for some time beyond the june 1 “x date” for raising the debt ceiling

if a default does occur the federal government will likely prioritize paying bond holders in order to avoid a technical default it remains unclear where medicare medicaid and social security would fall on the list of prioritiespolicy experts aren’t even sure the treasury department has the capacity to prioritize payments in a specific order
“social security and medicare are major sources of federal expenditure and in most scenarios they will be impacted” said katherine hempstead senior policy advisor at the robert wood johnson foundation “medicare is the financial backbone of our healthcare system so the consequences to hospitals and health care providers will be profound”
the us has never in history defaulted on its debt and there is no precedent for payments to federal health programs being delayed
“even approaching default could damage the economy as we saw in 2011” a centers for medicare  medicaid services cms spokesperson told the hill


  

the debt ceiling standoff in 2011 resulted in the us reaching the debt ceiling stock prices plummeting and the country’s credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history there are fears this fight could be even worse
“while the precise impact on cms’s programs depends on many uncertain factors it is clear that if the federal government is prevented from making good on its promises there would be significant consequences for medicaid medicare and the affordable care act marketplaces” cms added
in traditional medicare cms reimburses providers directly for services in the absence of available funding providers would have to prepare for reimbursements to stop coming in but there may be some cushion before that happens


  

the sluggish rate at which medicare bills are paid could help providers in the wake of a default according to joseph antos senior fellow at the american enterprise institute
“for at least a month maybe two months hospitals and doctors offices and other providers would continue to get payments from the medicare program but for services that they provided potentially months ago” antos said
and a 1996 amendment to the social security act could provide temporary relief if the default were to persist for some months the law states that federal trust funds cannot be cashed out for any purpose except for the “payment of benefits” such as social security and medicare the most recent report from the social security administration stated the trust has 283 trillion in reserves


  

“theoretically the treasury department could release very substantial sums of money which would then have to be used to pay federal bills” antos said “that includes medicare payments to medical providers it also includes social security but it also includes payments to defense contracts and the janitor at the department of health and human services building basically all of those would be paid kind of in the order as they come in”
in antos’s estimate if a default did come to pass it would only be a matter of weeks before lawmakers were cowed into reaching a deal and he believes federal health programs can survive for a few weeks
still others feel that the urgency of the situation isn’t quite hitting home for those on capitol hill


  

“the situation this year seems more serious in that you know one side of the discussionnamely the house republicans — seem to be less worried about the prospect of default than they should be” said paul van de water a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and a former staffer at the congressional budget office

“mccarthy has said that he doesn’t want the government to default that he recognizes the serious adverse impacts that would have but it’s not clear that all of the republican caucus feels the same way”
mccarthy has said that house republicans already passed their debt limit package and it’s up to the biden administration to respond he emerged from tuesday’s talks saying that the “structure” of the talks had improved 


  

but he added “i’m not more optimistic you’re only 15 days away and you’re trying to raise the debt ceiling”

Vice President Harris on Thursday convened a call of elected officials, local leaders and administration allies to warn of the dangers of a potential default as she takes on an increased role in the White House’s messaging on the debt ceiling.
Harris led a virtual briefing on the debt ceiling fight, where she underscored the White House’s position that Congress should lift the debt ceiling and urged local leaders on the call to inform their constituents of the possible consequences of inaction.


  

“Our position is clear and simple: Congress must act to prevent a default,” Harris said on the briefing, which was open to members of the media.
“We just need you, the leaders on this call, to do what you always do and make sure your voices are heard,” Harris added. “Make sure members of Congress know a default would not be acceptable under any circumstances. Let’s organize, activate our communities, and remind folks of what’s at stake and get the word about why this issue is so important.”
Thursday’s virtual briefing took place while President Biden is in Japan for the Group of Seven Summit through Sunday. It was the latest sign that Harris is taking on a larger role as the White House pushes Congress to raise the debt ceiling and seeks to warn the public about the fallout if lawmakers do not act.
Harris joined Biden and the top four congressional leaders in the Oval Office for a meeting Tuesday about the debt ceiling and budget negotiations. The White House and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have since appointed lead negotiators to try and hammer out an agreement in the coming days.
“While Joe Biden has left the country, border czar Kamala Harris is now involved in debt ceiling negotiations despite presiding over the worst border crisis in history,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement Thursday. “The Biden-Harris administration’s lack of leadership creates crisis after crisis, leaving American families to suffer the consequences, but they don’t care.”
The Treasury Department has warned the U.S. could default by early June if Congress does not act to raise the debt ceiling, which covers spending already approved by lawmakers.


  

Harris on Thursday warned a default, or even getting close to it, could raise borrowing rates, hurt retirement accounts by triggering a stock market downturn and risk sending the economy into a recession.
The vice president was joined on Thursday’s call by Lael Brainard, the head of the National Economic Council, and Steve Benjamin, who leads the White House Office of Public Engagement. 
Brainard told those on the call that negotiators are working toward a “reasonable bipartisan budget agreement, which we do every year.”


  

White House negotiations have been instructed to push back on any attempts to reverse Biden administration policies to combat climate change and lower drug costs and other expenses for middle class families, as well as any efforts to take away health care.
“The last thing American families need is a manufactured crisis that would destabilize the hard won progress we’ve seen for no reason,” Brainard said.

The White House has for months maintained Congress has a responsibility to raise the debt ceiling without conditions, pointing to the dozens of times lawmakers have done so in the past. But in recent days as negotiations have intensified, administration officials have signaled they are simultaneously willing to push for a debt limit increase and negotiate a budget agreement with Republicans who are looking for ways to slash government spending.


  

Designated negotiators for the White House and the Speaker are set to meet through this week, and the president and congressional leaders are expected to reconvene next week when Biden has returned from Japan.
The president scrapped plans to visit Australia and Papua New Guinea next week in order to return for budget talks.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announced plans to file articles of impeachment against President Biden on Thursday, alleging he has violated his oath of office in not securing the country’s borders and protecting national security. 
Greene said at a press conference this will be the “first set” of articles she introduces against Biden, whom she said has purposefully failed to fulfill his responsibilities of the presidency.


  

“It is with the highest amount of solemnity that I announce my intention to introduce articles of impeachment today on the head of this America-last executive branch, that has been working since Jan. 20, 2021, to systematically destroy this country, the president of the United States, Joseph Robinette Biden,” Greene said.
Greene made a similar announcement two days ago regarding her plans to introduce articles of impeachment against FBI Director Christopher Wray and Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

Greene said she has also introduced articles of impeachment against Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
The White House called Greene’s plan a “stunt,” noting Biden is focused on “preventing House Republicans’ default that would crash the economy.”
“Is there a bigger example of a shameless sideshow political stunt than a trolling impeachment attack by one of the most extreme MAGA members in Congress over ‘national security’ while she actively demands to defund the FBI and even said she ‘would’ve been armed’ and ‘would have won’ the January 6 insurrection, if only she’d been in charge of it?” said Ian Sams, White House spokesman for oversight and investigations.


  

Greene initially introduced articles of impeachment against Biden on the first day of his presidency. She also filed articles against Garland in August following the search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property for the classified and sensitive documents taken there. Neither advanced in the House.

The Georgia Republican and ally of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Biden has refused to enforced immigration laws and secure the border, “deliberately” compromising U.S. national security. She said he has allowed migrants to “invade” the country while depriving border control agents of the resources and policies they need to perform their duties.
Greene said Biden has allowed fentanyl to “flood” into the country and kill Americans every day.


  

She also slammed the administration over its plan to direct Customs and Border Protection to release migrants into the U.S. without a set court date or way to track them. Under the plan, migrants need to check in with an app until they are given a court date to appear.
Greene said it amounts to “catch-and-release,” allowing the migrants to be released instead of being held in custody until their court date.
“His policies, directives and statements surrounding the southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country,” she said. “Biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty, and he is a direct threat to our national security.”

Article II of the Constitution states that the president and other U.S. officials can be removed from office through impeachment and conviction on “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”
Greene said she wants to take time to gather cosponsors on her impeachment resolutions. She avoided directly answering a question on what exact charges she would file against Biden.


  

She said she discussed her plans to file the impeachment articles with other members of Republican leadership and said they did not ask her not to move forward.
She said she is introducing the articles because a majority the “base” of Republican voters and other Americans outside it agree with impeaching these officials, describing it as “the right thing to do.”
“There’s never any consequences for anyone in the federal government when regular American citizens face consequences all the time, and I’m introducing these articles because this is what people are demanding,” Greene said.

Mayorkas has faced intense criticism from many Republicans over the situation at the southern border, which experienced a record number of migrant crossings in recent months. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) called for Mayorkas’s impeachment last week.
Greene alleges Wray and Garland have turned the FBI and Justice Department into Biden’s “personal police force” to prosecute the administration’s political opponents. She claimed that those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection were mostly peaceful, but Garland has still pursued them. A bipartisan Senate report found last year that seven people died related to the attack on the Capitol that day.
Greene said Wray prioritizes his own party above performing his job, wrongly identifying the Republican Wray as a Democrat. He has been director of the FBI since August 2017 and was nominated by former President Trump.


  

She said she is filing impeachment articles against Graves, the U.S. attorney, over his prosecutions of Jan. 6 defendants, which she said have continued while he has declined to prosecute 67 percent of people arrested by Washington, D.C., police last year.
“That affects people in our nation’s capital, just regular innocent people that live and work here. I think as our conference learns more and more on this, they’ll understand it,” she said.
Greene said employees are fired from their jobs if they are corrupt or are not adequately serving their employers. She said all five officials are corrupt and unfit to hold office, so they must be impeached.

rep marjorie taylor greene rga announced plans to file articles of impeachment against president biden on thursday alleging he has violated his oath of office in not securing the country’s borders and protecting national security 
greene said at a press conference this will be the “first set” of articles she introduces against biden whom she said has purposefully failed to fulfill his responsibilities of the presidency


  

“it is with the highest amount of solemnity that i announce my intention to introduce articles of impeachment today on the head of this americalast executive branch that has been working since jan 20 2021 to systematically destroy this country the president of the united states joseph robinette biden” greene said
greene made a similar announcement two days ago regarding her plans to introduce articles of impeachment against fbi director christopher wray and matthew graves the us attorney for the district of columbia

rep marjorie taylor greene rga listens to testimony during the house oversight and accountability committee hearing entitled “overdue oversight of the capital city part ii” at the capitol on tuesday may 16th 2023 tierney l cross
greene said she has also introduced articles of impeachment against attorney general merrick garland and secretary of homeland security alejandro mayorkas
the white house called greene’s plan a “stunt” noting biden is focused on “preventing house republicans’ default that would crash the economy”
“is there a bigger example of a shameless sideshow political stunt than a trolling impeachment attack by one of the most extreme maga members in congress over ‘national security’ while she actively demands to defund the fbi and even said she ‘would’ve been armed’ and ‘would have won’ the january 6 insurrection if only she’d been in charge of it” said ian sams white house spokesman for oversight and investigations


  

greene initially introduced articles of impeachment against biden on the first day of his presidency she also filed articles against garland in august following the search of former president trump’s maralago property for the classified and sensitive documents taken there neither advanced in the house

the georgia republican and ally of house speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif said biden has refused to enforced immigration laws and secure the border “deliberately” compromising us national security she said he has allowed migrants to “invade” the country while depriving border control agents of the resources and policies they need to perform their duties
greene said biden has allowed fentanyl to “flood” into the country and kill americans every day


  

she also slammed the administration over its plan to direct customs and border protection to release migrants into the us without a set court date or way to track them under the plan migrants need to check in with an app until they are given a court date to appear
greene said it amounts to “catchandrelease” allowing the migrants to be released instead of being held in custody until their court date
“his policies directives and statements surrounding the southern border have violated our laws and destroyed our country” she said “biden has blatantly violated his constitutional duty and he is a direct threat to our national security”


  


president joe biden gestures as he boards air force one at andrews air force base md wednesday may 17 2023 as he heads to hiroshima japan to attend the g7 ap photojess rapfogel
article ii of the constitution states that the president and other us officials can be removed from office through impeachment and conviction on “treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors”
greene said she wants to take time to gather cosponsors on her impeachment resolutions she avoided directly answering a question on what exact charges she would file against biden


  

she said she discussed her plans to file the impeachment articles with other members of republican leadership and said they did not ask her not to move forward
she said she is introducing the articles because a majority the “base” of republican voters and other americans outside it agree with impeaching these officials describing it as “the right thing to do”
“there’s never any consequences for anyone in the federal government when regular american citizens face consequences all the time and i’m introducing these articles because this is what people are demanding” greene said


  




		latest border figures show 56 percent drop in encounters following lift of title 42	


mayorkas has faced intense criticism from many republicans over the situation at the southern border which experienced a record number of migrant crossings in recent months house majority whip tom emmer rminn called for mayorkas’s impeachment last week
greene alleges wray and garland have turned the fbi and justice department into biden’s “personal police force” to prosecute the administration’s political opponents she claimed that those who participated in the jan 6 2021 insurrection were mostly peaceful but garland has still pursued them a bipartisan senate report found last year that seven people died related to the attack on the capitol that day
greene said wray prioritizes his own party above performing his job wrongly identifying the republican wray as a democrat he has been director of the fbi since august 2017 and was nominated by former president trump


  

she said she is filing impeachment articles against graves the us attorney over his prosecutions of jan 6 defendants which she said have continued while he has declined to prosecute 67 percent of people arrested by washington dc police last year
“that affects people in our nation’s capital just regular innocent people that live and work here i think as our conference learns more and more on this they’ll understand it” she said
greene said employees are fired from their jobs if they are corrupt or are not adequately serving their employers she said all five officials are corrupt and unfit to hold office so they must be impeached

Automakers Hyundai Motor America and Kia America Inc. have agreed to pay roughly $200 million to settle a class-action lawsuit after the car companies saw a rise in thefts.
“The agreement, which could be valued at approximately $200 million depending on how many customers elect to participate, will provide cash compensation for customers who incurred theft-related vehicle losses or damage not covered by insurance, in addition to reimbursement for insurance deductibles, increased insurance premiums, and other theft-related losses,” Hyundai said in a release.


  

Security concerns about certain Hyundai and Kia car models arose after a viral TikTok challenge highlighted security weak points and showed how to hot-wire the vehicles. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in February that the social media challenge had led to at least 14 crashes and eight fatalities. 
Hyundai and Kia rolled out free software updates to shore up the cars’ security, for which about 3.8 million Hyundais and 4.5 million Kias were estimated to be eligible — but the thefts did not appear to abate. The companies have also been working to distribute tens of thousands of steering wheel locks for impacted vehicles. 
Last month, 18 state attorneys general sounded the alarm in a letter to the Department of Transportation about the vehicles.

The issues affect Hyundai and Kia vehicles “without push-button ignitions and immobilizing anti-theft devices,” according to Hyundai. Customers whose cars can’t take the new software upgrade will get up to $300 to buy anti-theft devices, per the agreement. 
“We appreciate the opportunity to provide additional support for our owners who have been impacted by increasing and persistent criminal activity targeting our vehicles,” said Jason Erb, Hyundai Motor North America’s chief legal officer. 


  

Kia’s chief legal officer, John Yoon, said the agreement is the latest step “taken to help customers whose vehicles have been targeted by criminals using methods of theft popularized on social media.”

With the White House and House leadership less than two weeks away from a default deadline on the country’s debt, anxiety is rising over the potential impact on federal programs such as Medicaid and the beneficiaries who depend on it.
Among the sticking points is Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) push for work requirements to be added to federal assistance programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.


  

McCarthy told reporters before a meeting with President Biden on Tuesday that adding work requirements was a “red line” for him, while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has called the proposal a “nonstarter.”
Health care policy experts say a default would be a disaster for the federal programs, though some think the government could stave off the impact on beneficiaries for some time beyond the June 1 “X date” for raising the debt ceiling.

LAST WEEK: Takeaways from initial White House debt ceiling meeting


If a default does occur, the federal government will likely prioritize paying bond holders in order to avoid a technical default. It remains unclear where Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security would fall on the list of priorities — policy experts aren’t even sure the Treasury Department has the capacity to prioritize payments in a specific order.
“Social Security and Medicare are major sources of federal expenditure, and in most scenarios, they will be impacted,” said Katherine Hempstead, senior policy advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “Medicare is the financial backbone of our healthcare system, so the consequences to hospitals and health care providers will be profound.”
The U.S. has never in history defaulted on its debt, and there is no precedent for payments to federal health programs being delayed.
“Even approaching default could damage the economy, as we saw in 2011,” a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) spokesperson told The Hill.


  

The debt ceiling standoff in 2011 resulted in the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling, stock prices plummeting and the country’s credit rating being downgraded for the first time in history. There are fears this fight could be even worse.
“While the precise impact on CMS’s programs depends on many uncertain factors, it is clear that if the federal government is prevented from making good on its promises, there would be significant consequences for Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces,” CMS added.
In traditional Medicare, CMS reimburses providers directly for services. In the absence of available funding, providers would have to prepare for reimbursements to stop coming in, but there may be some cushion before that happens.


  

The sluggish rate at which Medicare bills are paid could help providers in the wake of a default, according to Joseph Antos, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
“For at least a month, maybe two months, hospitals and doctors offices and other providers would continue to get payments from the Medicare program, but for services that they provided potentially months ago,” Antos said.
And a 1996 amendment to the Social Security Act could provide temporary relief if the default were to persist for some months. The law states that federal trust funds cannot be cashed out for any purpose except for the “payment of benefits,” such as Social Security and Medicare. The most recent report from the Social Security Administration stated the trust has $2.83 trillion in reserves.


  

“Theoretically, the Treasury Department could release very substantial sums of money, which would then have to be used to pay federal bills,” Antos said. “That includes Medicare payments to medical providers. It also includes Social Security but it also includes payments to defense contracts and the janitor at the [Department of Health and Human Services] building. Basically all of those would be paid, kind of in the order as they come in.”
In Antos’s estimate, if a default did come to pass, it would only be a matter of weeks before lawmakers were cowed into reaching a deal, and he believes federal health programs can survive for a few weeks.
Still, others feel that the urgency of the situation isn’t quite hitting home for those on Capitol Hill.


  

“The situation this year seems more serious in that, you know, one side of the discussion — namely the House Republicans — seem to be less worried about the prospect of default than they should be,” said Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former staffer at the Congressional Budget Office.

“McCarthy has said that he doesn’t want the government to default, that he recognizes the serious adverse impacts that would have, but it’s not clear that all of the Republican caucus feels the same way.”
McCarthy has said that House Republicans already passed their debt limit package, and it’s up to the Biden administration to respond. He emerged from Tuesday’s talks saying that the “structure” of the talks had improved. 


  

But he added, “I’m not more optimistic. You’re only 15 days away, and you’re trying to raise the debt ceiling.”

Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) sent a letter to Brendan Whitworth, the Anheuser-Busch CEO and chairman of the Beer Institute, urging him to open an investigation into whether the company violated guidelines that prohibit beer companies from promoting their products to a younger audience. The Beer Institute is the beer industry’s self-regulatory body that establishes buying and advertising guidelines for beer companies to follow. 


  

The senators allege that Mulvaney’s TikTok series, “Days of Girlhood,” skews her audience to those whose ages are younger than the Beer Institute’s guidelines. 
The letter specifically pointed to various TikTok videos Mulvaney posted leading up to her partnership with Bud Light, where she posted a sponsored video of her drinking a can of beer. 
“The use of the phrase ‘Girlhood’ was not a slip of the tongue but rather emblematic of a series of Mulvaney’s online content that was specifically used to target, market to, and attract an audience of young people who are well below the legal drinking age in the United States,” the senators wrote. 
They called on Whitworth to cut the company’s ties with Mulvaney and apologize for allegedly marketing its products to an underage audience. The duo also asked for more information about how the company vets its partnerships, specifically its collaboration with Mulvaney.

“We would urge you, in your capacity at Anheuser-Busch, to avoid a lengthy investigation by the Beer Institute by instead having Anheuser-Busch publicly sever its relationship with Dylan Mulvaney, publicly apologize to the American people for marketing alcoholic beverages to minors, and direct Dylan Mulvaney to remove any Anheuser-Busch content from” her social media platforms, the senators wrote. 
Cruz also reiterated the letter he sent while on “Fox and Friends” Thursday, accusing Anheuser-Busch of marketing its content to teenagers. 


  

“We’re calling on the Beer Institute to investigate the degree to which Anheuser-Busch knowingly was marketing to children in going down this road,” Cruz said.

Health care organizations including Planned Parenthood are suspending gender-affirming medical care in Florida to comply with a new state law that bans transition-related care for transgender minors and places heavy restrictions on care for adults.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who is expected to enter the 2024 presidential race next week, on Wednesday signed legislation immediately prohibiting health care professionals from administering puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy and surgeries to transgender minors.


  

Those who violate the law risk being convicted of a third-degree felony crime, punishable by up to five years in prison, according to Florida’s criminal code.
The new law places additional restrictions on adult access to gender-affirming health care, despite being billed by Republicans in the state legislature as a measure to protect young children from making medical decisions they may later regret. 
The legislation substantially reduces the number of providers able to administer care by allowing only physicians to provide gender-affirming services, meaning other health care professionals — including physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives — are unable to provide care that is considered medically necessary by most major medical organizations.
Gender-affirming health care for adults, according to the new law, may only be administered once an informed consent form is signed, but the state medical boards tasked with drafting the forms have not yet done so, forcing health care providers across the state into a difficult position.
“It’s clear that the law was designed not only to restrict care for adults, but to cause an immediate gap in access — providers across the state are being forced to pause services because the law took effect immediately, and the state hasn’t promulgated the required consent forms needed to comply,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood told The Hill on Friday.
The organization has initiated a temporary pause on gender-affirming health care in the state, they said. Care is likely to resume in mid-June.


  

In an emailed statement, Planned Parenthood of South, East, and North Florida (PPSENFL) said the pause will be used to make “operational adjustments to comply with the new law, which now forbids our skilled and competent nurse practitioners from providing gender-affirming care.”
“We will have to reorganize physician schedules, develop new consent forms with language that complies with the new requirements of the law, and change the delivery of that care as we are only allowed to offer telehealth for some appointments,” the organization said. “Our commitment to providing high-quality, compassionate care to our gender-affirming hormone therapy patients remains unwavering. We will navigate these changes together.”
Patients who have had their appointments canceled because of the pause will be contacted to reschedule by June 12, PPSENFL said.


  

The new Florida law appears to have driven other, smaller providers to halt the administration of adult gender-affirming care, too.
“As a result of SB 254, and to meet the requirements set out by the State of Florida, it is with deep regret that we are no longer able to provide Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), surgical clearance letters and gender marker letters to our transgender, gender nonbinary, and gender nonconforming patients,” reads a statement posted Wednesday by 26Health, an LGBTQ health center in Orlando.
“While we are unable to provide these services at this time, 26Health firmly believes that our transgender, gender nonbinary, and gender nonconforming community members deserve to live fully and openly as their truest selves,” the statement continues. “We will continue to provide care to our gender diverse community members including primary care and mental health services, which are incredibly important during this difficult climate.”

Folx Health, an online-only provider, announced this week after Senate Bill 254 was signed that it would no longer be able to legally prescribe gender-affirming hormone therapy to patients, as the new law requires consent forms to be signed during an in-person visit with a doctor.
The group said it is working to hire more physicians “who are licensed and living in Florida” and open in-person locations in “major hubs across the state.”
“You will hear from us again as soon as we have information about how to set up in person care or take other necessary steps, as the legal implications become clearer,” the announcement states. “We are here for you and are so sorry your healthcare rights are at stake.”

Congressional Progressi… [+3710 chars]","

Dozens of progressives have signed onto a letter urging President Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment and bypass Republicans to prevent the nation from defaulting on its debt. 
Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC)  leaders Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Greg Casar (D-Texas) led more than 60 progressives in penning the letter to Biden on Friday, as the president attends the Group of Seven (G-7) summit abroad this week. 


  

“If the options are either agreeing to major cuts to domestic priorities under the Republican threat of destroying the economy and moving forward to honor America’s debts, we join prominent legal scholars, economists, former budget officials, and a former president in advocating for invoking the 14th Amendment of the Constitution,” they wrote. 
“Not only does the debt ceiling run counter to the Constitution’s mandate that the validity of America’s public debt shall not be questioned, it contradicts the appropriations law that requires the Treasury to issue debt for the funding you are obligated to administer at Congress’s direction,” the group added. 

President Biden speaks with Reps. Nanette Barragan (D-Calif.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) following an event to introduce nominee to be Secretary of Labor Julie Su in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, March 1, 2023. (Greg Nash)
The letter comes as Republican negotiators indicated that bipartisan talks to resolve the nation’s debt limit fight had hit a roadblock on Friday — and blamed the White House.
Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the negotiations were on pause, claiming the other side failed to make adequate concessions on spending cuts.
“We’ve got to get movement by the White House, and we don’t have any movement yet. So, yeah, we’ve gotta pause,” McCarthy said.  


  

“Yesterday I really felt we were at the location where I could see the path. The White House is just — look, we can’t be spending more money next year. We have to spend less than we spent the year before. It’s pretty easy.”

It also came a day after the House Freedom Caucus pushed the Senate to pass the GOP conference’s partisan debt limit package, with the group calling for “no further discussion” until it makes it out of Congress.
The statement from the hardline conservative caucus was thought to pose a threat to the GOP conference’s unity amid bipartisan debt limit negotiations between the White House and Republican leaders. 


  

But ​​House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry (R-Pa.) seemed to try to dial back some of the heat later on Thursday, telling CBS: “We’re not saying you can’t continue to talk, but until they’re willing to tell us what they’re willing to do, it’s hard to come to an agreement.”
Liberals and conservatives alike have been raising concerns over how far leaders on both sides will go to strike a bipartisan deal to prevent a federal default.

In their letter to Biden on Friday, progressives accused Republicans of “economic ransom,” while pressing the president against concessions that could lead to “devastating budget cuts, additional work requirements for essential food and economic support, and fast-tracking fossil fuel projects that undermine our shared climate achievements is antithetical to our shared Democratic values.”
They went on to argue that Biden should invoke the 14th Amendment, which says “the validity of the public debt of the United States … shall not be questioned,” to try to continue to issue debt to make federal payments.
But there are serious questions about the legality of such a move. And the stakes are high, as experts warn the nation’s economy could face catastrophic consequences if lawmakers fail to act quickly on the debt limit.

Meanwhile, conservatives are stepping up pressure for both sides to produce a deal that would enact new limits on annual government funding, permitting reform and changes to work requirements or federal assistance programs, among other proposals. 
Less than two weeks stands between Congress and the June 1 deadline forecasted by the Treasury Department as the earliest the nation risks federal default.

dozens of progressives have signed onto a letter urging president biden to invoke the 14th amendment and bypass republicans to prevent the nation from defaulting on its debt 
congressional progressive caucus cpc  leaders pramila jayapal dwash ilhan omar dminn and greg casar dtexas led more than 60 progressives in penning the letter to biden on friday as the president attends the group of seven g7 summit abroad this week 


  

“if the options are either agreeing to major cuts to domestic priorities under the republican threat of destroying the economy and moving forward to honor america’s debts we join prominent legal scholars economists former budget officials and a former president in advocating for invoking the 14th amendment of the constitution” they wrote 
“not only does the debt ceiling run counter to the constitution’s mandate that the validity of america’s public debt shall not be questioned it contradicts the appropriations law that requires the treasury to issue debt for the funding you are obligated to administer at congress’s direction” the group added

the letter comes as republican negotiators indicated that bipartisan talks to resolve the nation’s debt limit fight had hit a roadblock on friday — and blamed the white house
speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif said the negotiations were on pause claiming the other side failed to make adequate concessions on spending cuts
“we’ve got to get movement by the white house and we don’t have any movement yet so yeah we’ve gotta pause” mccarthy said

in their letter to biden on friday progressives accused republicans of “economic ransom” while pressing the president against concessions that could lead to “devastating budget cuts additional work requirements for essential food and economic support and fasttracking fossil fuel projects that undermine our shared climate achievements is antithetical to our shared democratic values”
they went on to argue that biden should invoke the 14th amendment which says “the validity of the public debt of the united states … shall not be questioned” to try to continue to issue debt to make federal payments

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) released a campaign-style video Thursday, further fueling speculation about a possible 2024 presidential bid.
“It’s pretty overwhelming to contemplate the future of America,” Youngkin says in the video, which pulled remarks from the governor’s address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in April.


  

“It’s such an honor to be here with proud Americans who carry on President Reagan’s cherished legacy. He brought peace by projected strength,” Youngkin said. “At a time when it’s easy for us to lose faith, to worry that we are indeed that one generation when freedom becomes extinct, there are lights shining.” 
“We can usher in a new era of American values,” he continued. “President Ronald Reagan changed lives, and now it’s our turn. A time to choose life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness over oppression and dictatorial rule. That stakes are high and the consequences couldn’t be greater.”

The video, which was paid for by the governor’s Spirit of Virginia PAC, comes after Youngkin said earlier this month that he would not head out on the presidential campaign trail this year.
“I’m going to be working in Virginia this year,” he said at an event at the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C.

However, the Virginia governor has continued to stoke speculation about a White House run, appearing not to completely rule out a potential 2024 presidential bid, with an aide telling The Hill at the time that Youngkin’s statement about “working in Virginia” was an answer to a question and meant to reiterate that he was focused on his state in 2023. 
Youngkin has been floated as a potential Republican presidential contender since winning Virginia’s 2021 gubernatorial election as a first-time political candidate in a state that had consistently moved left in the previous decade.


  

He continued to raise 2024 speculation earlier this year by traveling outside of Virginia to meet with donors and traveling to Taiwan on a trade mission.

American Airlines and JetBlue Airways must abandon their partnership in the northeast United States, a federal judge in Boston ruled Friday, saying that the government proved the deal reduces competition in the airline industry.
The ruling is a major victory for the Biden administration, which has used aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws to fight against mergers and other arrangements between large corporations. 


  

The Justice Department argued during a trial last fall that the deal would eventually cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin wrote in his decision that American and JetBlue violated antitrust law as they carved up Northeast markets between them, “replacing full-throated competition with broad cooperation.”
The judge said the airlines offered only minimal evidence that the partnership, called the Northeast Alliance, helped consumers.
The airlines said they were considering whether to appeal.
“We believe the decision is wrong and are considering next steps,” said American spokesman Matt Miller. “The court’s legal analysis is plainly incorrect and unprecedented for a joint venture like the Northeast Alliance. There was no evidence in the record of any consumer harm from the partnership.”
JetBlue spokeswoman Emily Martin said her airline was disappointed, adding, “We made it clear at trial that the Northeast Alliance has been a huge win for customers.”


  

The Justice Department, meanwhile, hailed the ruling.
“Today’s decision is a win for Americans who rely on competition between airlines to travel affordably,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
The partnership had the blessing of the Trump administration when it took effect in early 2021. It let the airlines sell seats on each other’s flights and share revenue from them. It covered many of their flights to and from Boston’s Logan Airport and three airports in the New York City area: John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty in New Jersey.


  

But soon after President Joe Biden took office, the Justice Department took another look. It found an economist who predicted that consumers would spend more than $700 million a year extra because of reduced competition.
American is the largest U.S. airline and JetBlue is the sixth-biggest overall. But in Boston, they hold down two of the top three spots, alongside Delta Air Lines, and two of the top four positions in New York.
The Justice Department sued to kill the deal in 2021, and was joined by six states and the District of Columbia. 


  

“It is a very important case to us … because of those families that need to travel and want affordable tickets and good service,” Justice Department lawyer Bill Jones said during closing arguments.
The trial featured testimony by current and former airline CEOs and economists who gave wildly different opinions on how the deal would affect competition and ticket prices.
The airlines and their expert witnesses argued that the government couldn’t show that the alliance, which had been in place for about 18 months at the time, had led to higher fares. They said it helped them start new routes from New York and Boston. And most importantly, they said, the deal benefitted consumers by creating more competition against Delta and United Airlines.


  

The judge was not persuaded.
“Though the defendants claim their bigger-is-better collaboration will benefit the flying public, they produced minimal objectively credible proof to support that claim,” he wrote. “Whatever the benefits to American and JetBlue of becoming more powerful — in the northeast generally or in their shared rivalry with Delta — such benefits arise from a naked agreement not to compete with one another.”
Hanging over the trial was JetBlue’s proposed $3.8 billion purchase of Spirit Airlines, the nation’s largest discount carrier. In March, while Sorokin was mulling his decision, the Justice Department sued to block that deal too, arguing that it would reduce competition and be especially harmful to consumers who depend on Spirit to save money.


  

JetBlue has countered that acquiring Spirit will make it a bigger, stronger low-cost competitor to Delta, United, Southwest — and American — which together control about 80% of the domestic U.S. air-travel market. 
The government’s lawsuit against the JetBlue-Spirit deal is pending before a different judge in the same Boston courthouse.

The White House on Friday night tempered its optimism about ongoing talks with Republicans on a budget agreement and debt ceiling increase, acknowledging the two sides have “serious differences” heading into the weekend.
“We have serious differences and this is going to continue to be a difficult conversation. That’s not lost on us,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in Japan, where President Biden is attending the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit. 


  

“We are optimistic, the president is optimistic that we’re going to get to a reasonable budget negotiation, a budget agreement here, a bipartisan budget agreement,” Jean-Pierre added. “This is something that has to pass the House and the Senate. It’s going to need both Democrats and Republicans.”
The White House and Republican negotiators have shifted their tone since Thursday, when Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested a deal could be within reach and the White House touted “steady progress” in meetings between negotiators.
Talks were paused on Friday afternoon as Republicans complained that the White House was being “unreasonable.” The White House, meanwhile, said there were “real differences,” but has been adamant that any final agreement must be bipartisan and reflective of a compromise.
The conversation resumed Friday evening.
Jean-Pierre, speaking to reporters on Saturday morning local time in Hiroshima, said “there is definitely a path forward,” but that negotiators needed time and space to work through their differences.
Biden would be updated on talks as they progressed, Jean-Pierre said. The president is set to return to Washington, D.C., on Sunday after he scrapped plans to visit Australia and Papua New Guinea next week.


  

Time is of the essence for negotiators, as the Treasury Department has warned the U.S. could default as early as June 1 if Congress does not act to raise the debt ceiling.
Jean-Pierre was adamant that the White House was still technically not negotiating with Republicans about the debt ceiling, instead framing it as a “separate conversation about the budget.” But Republicans, who control the House, have made clear they will not pass any debt limit increase without an agreement on spending cuts.
“It cannot be held hostage by Republicans, we have been very clear, by these MAGA Republicans, by the Speaker,” Jean-Pierre said. “We have continued to lay out what the consequences could be, not just to members of the Hill but to the American people.”


  

One administration official noted that Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) earlier this week acknowledged any final agreement would have to be bipartisan to pass both the GOP-controlled House and the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Republicans seek to cap overall discretionary spending at fiscal year 2022 levels while allowing for 1 percent growth per year for 10 years. Congress passed an omnibus funding bill for fiscal year 2023 in December.

A memo released this week said that if the topline discretionary number is set at that level, and if Republicans hold firm on commitments to not cut defense spending or the budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security, other programs would be slashed by 30 percent.

the white house on friday night tempered its optimism about ongoing talks with republicans on a budget agreement and debt ceiling increase acknowledging the two sides have “serious differences” heading into the weekend
“we have serious differences and this is going to continue to be a difficult conversation that’s not lost on us” press secretary karine jeanpierre told reporters in japan where president biden is attending the group of seven g7 summit 


  

“we are optimistic the president is optimistic that we’re going to get to a reasonable budget negotiation a budget agreement here a bipartisan budget agreement” jeanpierre added “this is something that has to pass the house and the senate it’s going to need both democrats and republicans”
the white house and republican negotiators have shifted their tone since thursday when speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif suggested a deal could be within reach and the white house touted “steady progress” in meetings between negotiators
talks were paused on friday afternoon as republicans complained that the white house was being “unreasonable” the white house meanwhile said there were “real differences” but has been adamant that any final agreement must be bipartisan and reflective of a compromise
the conversation resumed friday evening
jeanpierre speaking to reporters on saturday morning local time in hiroshima said “there is definitely a path forward” but that negotiators needed time and space to work through their differences
biden would be updated on talks as they progressed jeanpierre said the president is set to return to washington dc on sunday after he scrapped plans to visit australia and papua new guinea next week


  

time is of the essence for negotiators as the treasury department has warned the us could default as early as june 1 if congress does not act to raise the debt ceiling
jeanpierre was adamant that the white house was still technically not negotiating with republicans about the debt ceiling instead framing it as a “separate conversation about the budget” but republicans who control the house have made clear they will not pass any debt limit increase without an agreement on spending cuts
“it cannot be held hostage by republicans we have been very clear by these maga republicans by the speaker” jeanpierre said “we have continued to lay out what the consequences could be not just to members of the hill but to the american people”


  

one administration official noted that speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif earlier this week acknowledged any final agreement would have to be bipartisan to pass both the gopcontrolled house and the democratcontrolled senate

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) on Sunday called the looming potential of default a “manufactured crisis,” pointing to previous debt ceiling increases under former President Trump. 
“This is a manufactured crisis,” Reed said on “Fox News Sunday.” “For three times, President Trump came to the Congress and asked us to pass a unconditional debt ceiling increase.” 


  

“Even after he had increased the debts dramatically by his tax cuts, we did that, because we understood the risk of the economy, the risk of the American people, the risk of our national security standing,” he added.
There are less than two weeks left until the so-called x-date — the date that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has marked as the earliest possible time that the U.S. could default if lawmakers do not raise the debt ceiling.
Negotiations between the White House and Republicans broke down on Saturday as both sides accused the other of a lack of movement, heightening concerns about a potential default.
“This is completely avoidable,” Reed said. “All the Speaker has to do is what Democrats did — Senator [Chuck] Schumer, Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi — pass a clean debt ceiling and then sit down and negotiate a budget and put everything on the table there.”

Republicans have insisted that a debt ceiling increase be accompanied by widespread spending cuts, while Biden and Democrats have pushed for a “clean” increase of the debt limit.
“This is reckless and that’s exactly what they’re trying to do,” Reed added. “And again, the best point to reference is the fact that under President Trump, we understood the dangers of default, and we acted responsibly and reasonably.”


  

Reed was one of 11 Senate Democrats who urged President Biden earlier this week to “prepare to exercise your authority under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution” to act unilaterally on the debt ceiling.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) suggested on Sunday that lawmakers should move to “Plan B” after debt ceiling negotiations between the White House and Republicans broke down once again.
“I’m extremely worried about where we are now. I think the markets are going to get shaky,” Van Hollen said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think we need to move to Plan B, which is what’s called the discharge petition in the House.”


  

“It seems to me we’re going to have to move in that direction pretty soon,” he added.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he is ""extremely worried"" amid ongoing debt and budget negotiations, telling @MarthaRaddatz that Democrats should now look to their ""Plan B"" to try to move their own deal through the House via a discharge petition. https://t.co/DrVev3kh3Z pic.twitter.com/zDRSQ5hBdK— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) May 21, 2023

A discharge petition would allow Democrats to bypass Republican leaders in the House if they can secure majority support for a proposal. This would require at least five House Republicans to defect from their conference.
Democrats began collecting signatures on the petition last Wednesday, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) urging every member of his caucus to get behind the effort.
The push to consider other options to avoid a potentially catastrophic default comes after Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) signaled on Saturday that debt limit negotiations could not move forward until President Biden returned from a Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Japan.
“Unfortunately, the White House moved backwards,” McCarthy told reporters. “I don’t think we’re going to be able to move forward until the president can get back in the country.”
Biden hit back on Sunday, calling on House Republicans to “move from their extreme positions.”


  

Van Hollen on Sunday also suggested that Biden should consider “all legal options” to address the debt ceiling, including using the 14th Amendment.

“It’s not the preferred option because there’s a lot of uncertainty around that approach,” he said, later adding, “The difference is that option would be better than a default. The United States has never defaulted in its history. It would create a catastrophe in the economy.” 
“So, the 14th Amendment is not the preferred alternative,” he added. “A lot of people predict that even if you go the route of the 14th Amendment you go into a recession. But if you default, we’re talking about depression.”

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday sidestepped a question about how the department would pick and choose which of the country’s bills would go unpaid if the U.S. defaults on its debt.
Yellen confirmed on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that some bills will go unpaid if the debt ceiling isn’t raised as soon as June 1, calling the limit a constraint on the country’s ability to pay its debts.


  

“Have you decided which bills those are going to be yet?” host Chuck Todd asked.
“Look, I would say we’re focused on raising the debt ceiling and there will be hard choices if that doesn’t occur. There can be no acceptable outcomes if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, regardless of what decisions we make,” Yellen said. 
Yellen has warned that the U.S. could default on its debt as soon as June 1, and said on Sunday that the odds of the country making it to June 15 while being able to pay all of the nation’s bills are “quite low.” 
President Biden is headed home early from an international trip so he can resume in-person negotiations on the debt ceiling with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). The White House has called for a clean debt ceiling increase, while House Republicans are pushing for an increase tied to spending cuts.

Both sides remained deadlocked, though McCarthy and Biden are set to speak by phone while Biden flies back to the U.S. from Japan as negotiations remain at a deadlock as of Sunday morning.
Biden said on Sunday that he thinks he has the authority to use a clause in the 14th Amendment to unilaterally address the debt ceiling, though Yellen expressed hesitation about the idea.


  

“It doesn’t seem like something that could be appropriately used in these circumstances, given the legal uncertainty around it, and given the tight timeframe we’re on,” she said.

sen jack reed dri on sunday called the looming potential of default a “manufactured crisis” pointing to previous debt ceiling increases under former president trump 
“this is a manufactured crisis” reed said on “ news sunday” “for three times president trump came to the congress and asked us to pass a unconditional debt ceiling increase” 


  

“even after he had increased the debts dramatically by his tax cuts we did that because we understood the risk of the economy the risk of the american people the risk of our national security standing” he added
there are less than two weeks left until the socalled xdatethe date that treasury secretary janet yellen has marked as the earliest possible time that the us could default if lawmakers do not raise the debt ceiling

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday sidestepped a question about how the department would pick and choose which of the country’s bills would go unpaid if the U.S. defaults on its debt.
Yellen confirmed on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that some bills will go unpaid if the debt ceiling isn’t raised as soon as June 1, calling the limit a constraint on the country’s ability to pay its debts.


  

“Have you decided which bills those are going to be yet?” host Chuck Todd asked.
“Look, I would say we’re focused on raising the debt ceiling and there will be hard choices if that doesn’t occur. There can be no acceptable outcomes if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, regardless of what decisions we make,” Yellen said. 
Yellen has warned that the U.S. could default on its debt as soon as June 1, and said on Sunday that the odds of the country making it to June 15 while being able to pay all of the nation’s bills are “quite low.” 
President Biden is headed home early from an international trip so he can resume in-person negotiations on the debt ceiling with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). The White House has called for a clean debt ceiling increase, while House Republicans are pushing for an increase tied to spending cuts.

Both sides remained deadlocked, though McCarthy and Biden are set to speak by phone while Biden flies back to the U.S. from Japan as negotiations remain at a deadlock as of Sunday morning.
Biden said on Sunday that he thinks he has the authority to use a clause in the 14th Amendment to unilaterally address the debt ceiling, though Yellen expressed hesitation about the idea.


  

“It doesn’t seem like something that could be appropriately used in these circumstances, given the legal uncertainty around it, and given the tight timeframe we’re on,” she said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) suggested on Sunday that lawmakers should move to “Plan B” after debt ceiling negotiations between the White House and Republicans broke down once again.
“I’m extremely worried about where we are now. I think the markets are going to get shaky,” Van Hollen said on ABC’s “This Week.” “I think we need to move to Plan B, which is what’s called the discharge petition in the House.”


  

“It seems to me we’re going to have to move in that direction pretty soon,” he added.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he is ""extremely worried"" amid ongoing debt and budget negotiations, telling @MarthaRaddatz that Democrats should now look to their ""Plan B"" to try to move their own deal through the House via a discharge petition. https://t.co/DrVev3kh3Z pic.twitter.com/zDRSQ5hBdK— This Week (@ThisWeekABC) May 21, 2023

A discharge petition would allow Democrats to bypass Republican leaders in the House if they can secure majority support for a proposal. This would require at least five House Republicans to defect from their conference.
Democrats began collecting signatures on the petition last Wednesday, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) urging every member of his caucus to get behind the effort.
The push to consider other options to avoid a potentially catastrophic default comes after Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) signaled on Saturday that debt limit negotiations could not move forward until President Biden returned from a Group of Seven (G-7) summit in Japan.
“Unfortunately, the White House moved backwards,” McCarthy told reporters. “I don’t think we’re going to be able to move forward until the president can get back in the country.”
Biden hit back on Sunday, calling on House Republicans to “move from their extreme positions.”


  

Van Hollen on Sunday also suggested that Biden should consider “all legal options” to address the debt ceiling, including using the 14th Amendment.

“It’s not the preferred option because there’s a lot of uncertainty around that approach,” he said, later adding, “The difference is that option would be better than a default. The United States has never defaulted in its history. It would create a catastrophe in the economy.” 
“So, the 14th Amendment is not the preferred alternative,” he added. “A lot of people predict that even if you go the route of the 14th Amendment you go into a recession. But if you default, we’re talking about depression.”

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday called the debt ceiling a “constraint” on the nation’s ability to pay its bills. 
“We take the debt ceiling seriously as a constraint on our ability to pay bills that are coming due. And my assumption is that if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, there will be hard choices to make about what bills go unpaid,” Yellen said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”


  

The Treasury secretary stressed the looming June deadline by which her department expects it may be unable to stave off default, and underscored the dire debt ceiling circumstances. 
“You’ll allow a default on some debt, if Congress doesn’t raise this debt ceiling?” host Chuck Todd asked Yellen on Sunday. 
“We have to pay interest in principle on outstanding debt. We also have obligations to seniors who count on Social Security, our military that expects pay, contractors who’ve provided services to the federal government, and some bills have to go unpaid,” Yellen responded.
“Have you decided which bills those are going to be yet?” Todd asked.
“Look, I would say we’re focused on raising the debt ceiling. And there will be hard choices if that doesn’t occur. There can be no acceptable outcomes if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, regardless of what decisions we make,” Yellen said.

(NEXSTAR) – Those working in the food service industry are, in most cases, paid a lower wage than the rest of us. It’s largely because they are expected to receive tips. 
But, as many have argued, paying a server the federal minimum wage for a tipped employee, paired with the tips they receive, sometimes isn’t enough to reach the standard minimum wage of $7.25. This is pushing some restaurants to transition to a tipless style of business. 


  

Current federal regulations require tipped employees — those who receive more than $30 in tips each month — be paid a minimum wage of $2.13. That server must then average $5.12 in tips each hour, meaning they would make the federal minimum wage of $7.25. If a server doesn’t earn enough tips in a shift to make $7.25 an hour, federal law says the employer must pay them the rest to reach that rate. 



		Student loan forgiveness: What to know as the Supreme Court mulls case	


While this may differ for some states, others do follow that federal minimum requirement, including Indiana, where one business owner decided to stop accepting tips. 
In 2021, Kurtis Cummings, the founder and president of Switchyard Brewing Company, decided to eliminate tipping at his Bloomington, Indiana, craft brewery. Instead, Switchyard employees are now paid at least $16.25 an hour.
“It’s the employer’s responsibility to pay their employees, not the customers,” Cummings explained to Nexstar. He also noted how factors such as the server’s gender or age, the weather, or the day of the week can impact how much – or how little – a server is tipped. 
Researchers have even found the vast majority of people aren’t basing the tip they leave on service quality, they’re actually just following a social norm. And when it comes to the quality of service, Cummings said that any issues you had shouldn’t be taken out on the server’s income. 



		Social Security COLA to drop significantly in 2024, senior group predicts	


“It’s still more than likely the company’s fault because it’s the company’s job to train, right?” he explained. Plus, the promise of a tip doesn’t always guarantee good service. What does? Like any non-tipped job, it’s job security, according to Cummings.


  

Cummings said Switchyard’s switch to tip-free “has become a real job attractor.” Staff no longer have to worry about missing a weekend shift – shifts that typically are busier, increasing the chance at more tips – and the company can provide other benefits like paid time off. 
While Cummings’ employees and most of their customers have taken to the idea of no more tipping, not everyone agrees. 
Cummings explained that after Switchyard transitioned to its optional-tipping policy, some people – many from outside Indiana – began leaving one-star Google reviews for the business. It’s a relatively common trend, Mike Lynn, a professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell University, told Nexstar’s KTLA.


  

Whether a restaurant adds a service charge or raises menu prices slightly, like Switchyard has, Lynn said that business will likely see their online ratings dip.

“It turns out that when customers evaluate restaurants’ expensiveness, they’re pretty much looking at menu prices, and that’s it,” Lynn explained. “We dismiss, or discount somehow, the fact that you’re expected to tip.”
Switchyard has been tip-free for roughly two years. Some, like Triptych Brewing in Savoy, Illinois, recently joined the movement, while others, like Optimism Brewing (which inspired Cummings) in Seattle and Zazie in San Francisco have been tip-free for years.

nexstar – those working in the food service industry are in most cases paid a lower wage than the rest of us it’s largely because they are expected to receive tips 
but as many have argued paying a server the federal minimum wage for a tipped employee paired with the tips they receive sometimes isn’t enough to reach the standard minimum wage of 725 this is pushing some restaurants to transition to a tipless style of business 


  

current federal regulations require tipped employeesthose who receive more than 30 in tips each monthbe paid a minimum wage of 213 that server must then average 512 in tips each hour meaning they would make the federal minimum wage of 725 if a server doesn’t earn enough tips in a shift to make 725 an hour federal law says the employer must pay them the rest to reach that rate

while this may differ for some states others do follow that federal minimum requirement including indiana where one business owner decided to stop accepting tips 
in 2021 kurtis cummings the founder and president of switchyard brewing company decided to eliminate tipping at his bloomington indiana craft brewery instead switchyard employees are now paid at least 1625 an hour
“it’s the employer’s responsibility to pay their employees not the customers” cummings explained to nexstar he also noted how factors such as the server’s gender or age the weather or the day of the week can impact how much – or how little – a server is tipped 
researchers have even found the vast majority of people aren’t basing the tip they leave on service quality they’re actually just following a social norm and when it comes to the quality of service cummings said that any issues you had shouldn’t be taken out on the server’s income

“it’s still more than likely the company’s fault because it’s the company’s job to train right” he explained plus the promise of a tip doesn’t always guarantee good service what does like any nontipped job it’s job security according to cummings


  

cummings said switchyard’s switch to tipfree “has become a real job attractor” staff no longer have to worry about missing a weekend shift – shifts that typically are busier increasing the chance at more tips – and the company can provide other benefits like paid time off 
while cummings’ employees and most of their customers have taken to the idea of no more tipping not everyone agrees

Congress and the White House have just 10 days to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling before the Treasury Department estimates the nation risks default.
But major sticking points have emerged in the past week.


  

Friday’s negotiations snagged on disagreements over spending but resumed over the weekend as pressure mounts on both sides to strike a deal. 



		Debt ceiling: Yellen says Treasury to run out of funds by ‘early June’ and possibly ‘June 1’	


President Biden is expected to meet with Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) later Monday.
Here are the key areas of disagreement that must be resolved with the June 1 “X-date” inching closer. 
Budget caps
Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).
Republicans are pushing to set limits on the government funding levels lawmakers can approve during the annual appropriations process later this year.
The GOP-led House last month passed a bill that would cap funding for fiscal 2024 at fiscal 2022 levels and doubled down on that position late last week.
McCarthy said Friday that “we can’t be spending more money next year. We have to spend less than we spent the year before. It’s pretty easy.”


  

But the proposal has garnered fierce pushback from Democrats and administration officials who say it would yield significant cuts to domestic programs.
Reports have surfaced in recent days that the White House offered a counterproposal that would flatline funding for the coming fiscal year at fiscal 2023 levels instead — but that it was rejected by Republicans.
Pressed about the proposal Monday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) didn’t reject the idea but said he “wanted to look at the full package and see a number of things.”


  

“First of all, does it seem fair? Second, does it make income inequality even worse? Is the rich getting richer? And third, who does it hurt, how badly? How many jobs do we lose? Do we spin into a recession because of the bill?” he said on a press call hosted by The Roosevelt Institute.
However, Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), chair of the House’s largest conservative caucus, cast doubts on the chances of the lower chamber passing such a proposal.
Pressed by The Hill Monday on the likelihood of such an occurrence, Hern said: “I don’t see it.”


  

Joel Friedman, senior vice president for federal fiscal policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a statement that the proposal to freeze funding at current levels into next year would “cut the services the government can provide by about 5 percent,” as the government works to tackle high inflation. 
Defense vs. nondefense
The Pentagon.
In their pursuit of cuts to government spending, Republicans have focused largely on reducing nondefense dollars, with many vowing to protect funding for veterans and defense programs — though the House-passed debt ceiling bill didn’t include any specific protections for them.
The White House’s proposed counteroffer included a freeze for nondefense and defense programs.


  

GOP appropriators have acknowledged the spending caps could make it harder to plus up funding for those areas and mean further reductions to spending for nondefense programs that are key Democratic priorities. 
House GOP appropriations have released text for only a handful of the dozen government funding bills Congress must pass to set new spending levels for fiscal 2024. That includes funding for areas where they’ve resisted major cuts, such as veterans and military construction and homeland security, as well as spending bills for agriculture and legislative branch programs.
“If you accept the funding levels for these areas as reflecting House Republican priorities and assume defense will be protected, then everything else would need to be cut more than 13 percent under a freeze,” Friedman said. 


  

Work requirements   
President Biden.
The fight over tougher work requirements for federal assistance programs garnered major attention on Capitol Hill last week and remains unresolved.
In their House-passed debt limit bill, Republicans pressed for beefing up work requirements for Medicaid, as well as programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). 
Biden prompted confusion from Democrats earlier this month when he appeared to open the door to some stricter work requirements. He has apparently ruled out changes to Medicaid, but the conversation around SNAP and TANF has been less clear. 


  

While Democrats have come out in staunch opposition to the proposed changes — House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) called it a “nonstarter” — Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also drew a “red line” around the issue in talks. 
Timeline
The Capitol.
House Republicans have pushed for lifting the debt through March 2024 at the latest, eyeing what is likely to be another high-stakes standoff over the debt limit in the months leading up to the coming presidential election. 
Democrats have pushed back against the proposed timeline, however, instead calling for the debt ceiling to be lifted past next year’s election.
But Republicans have argued that concessions that move the party further from its proposed bill — which seeks to reduce deficit spending by more than $4 trillion over the next decade — should require more give from Democrats. 
“We’ve got $1.5 trillion for a year versus 4.8 trillion in cuts,” Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), head of the Republican Study Committee, told reporters last week. “So, it’s gonna get real difficult as [there’s] less and less spending cuts. I can’t imagine that the body would be in unity for $1 for dollar.”

Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was narrowly elected Speaker in January after 15 ballots, is coming under heavy pressure from conservatives not to agree to any debt ceiling deal that falls well short of the House-passed legislation that cut $4.8 trillion from the deficit.
So far, President Biden’s proposal to cap discretionary spending has fallen flat with McCarthy, who wants the White House to cut discretionary spending on domestic programs without cutting defense.  


  

McCarthy tried to sound optimistic about reaching a deal after meeting with Biden at the White House late Monday afternoon, telling reporters it was a “productive” session.  
“I believe we can still get there,” he insisted despite the gulf of differences between the two sides on spending and policy priorities.  
House Freedom Caucus members, such as Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), warn they won’t accept anything less than the House-passed bill.  
That leaves McCarthy with strikingly little room to maneuver.
The House bill cut discretionary spending to fiscal 2022 levels and then caps domestic discretionary spending to 1 percent growth over the next decade. It also expands work requirements for federal social aid programs and rescinds $30 billion in unspent COVID funding. 
House Republicans are also pushing for energy permitting reform, measures to secure the U.S.-Mexico border and to block Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student debt relief.  


  

Biden is holding fast against many of the Republican demands, which Democrats warn would hurt American families across the nation by cutting an array of federal programs, expecting McCarthy will back down.  
The president also is insisting wealthy companies and individuals contribute pay more in taxes as part of any deficit-reduction deal.
“Here’s the disagreement: We have to — I think we should be looking at tax loopholes and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share. I think revenue matters as well as — as long as you’re not taxing anybody under $400,000,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office at the start of his meeting with McCarthy. 


  

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who has met regularly with House conservatives this year to call for ambitious fiscal reforms, says Biden is used to Republican leaders “caving” on the debt limit, but he says this time will be different.  
“I think he’s being conditioned,” Scott said of Biden’s stance on cutting a debt limit deal with McCarthy.  
“Think about it, McConnell caved in 2021,” he added in an interview with The Hill, referring to the deal Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) offered Democrats to let them move debt limit legislation without having to face a Republican filibuster.  


  

“I don’t believe the House Republicans are going to cave, and I don’t think Senate Republicans are going to cave this time,” he said.  
Scott said the tax increases White House officials are pushing to include in a deficit-reduction deal would be a non-starter with Republicans in both chambers.  
“It’s what I predicted,” he said Monday. “Everything I’ve heard from people is that they’re pushing it,” referring to the tax reforms favored by the White House.  


  

Scott warned that if McCarthy agreed to any deal that includes tax increases, “he could never get it done in the House.” 
Jim Kessler, the executive vice president for policy at centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, said “Republicans have an unreasonable request on the table” but questioned whether McCarthy has much room to negotiate because any member of the House GOP conference could call for a snap leadership election if they don’t like what comes out of the talks. 
“The drama has always been — can a debt ceiling increase be passed and Kevin McCarthy keep his job? That’s not Joe Biden’s responsibility, but that’s one of the chips that Kevin McCarthy is playing on this,” he said.


  

“My expectation is they’ll get it done. I think we’ll see a lot more drama,” Kessler added. “If you’ve got a deadline of June 1, May 31 is a good day to pick as the moment when the deal is sealed. That’s the way Washington generally works.”
Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who initially withheld support for McCarthy’s bid to become Speaker in January, said the perceived threat to McCarthy’s job is overblown.  
“Literally nobody except the press is talking about removing McCarthy right now,” he posted on Twitter. 


  

But he also told the Washington Examiner in a statement that “Speaker McCarthy simply must deliver on the promises he made in January.” 
Former President Trump, who still wields a lot of influence among House Republicans, is urging them to force the nation into default unless Democrats agree to “massive cuts.” 
Trump doubled down on Friday, when he posted on his social media platform that, “Republicans should not make a deal on the debt ceiling unless they get everything they want (including the ‘kitchen sink.’)”
Republicans say polls show voters agree with them on spending cuts, but it’s unclear whether the White House is feeling significant pressure.
An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll of 1,680 adults nationwide found 6 in 10 people surveyed say an increase in the debt limit should be linked to reforms to cut the deficit, and two-thirds of respondents say they are worried about the economic impact if Congress fails to raise the debt limit by the June deadline.  
Anxiety is mounting in the financial markets as more money managers are taking precautions in case of a federal default as early as June 1. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen again on Monday warned the federal government may run out of money to pay its debts as early as that date.  
Axel Merk, the president and CIO of Merk Investments, pointed out Monday that Treasury bills maturing at the end of May before the debt limit deadline are yielding only 3.2 percent, while Treasuries maturing next month are yielding close to 6 percent.  
He pointed out that credit default swaps hedging against a possible default or market complications associated with a default scare are “elevated.”  
“There is some anxiety,” Merk said, though he explained that traders are positioning themselves because of technical issues. “T-bills are the oil of the financial system; they grease the wheels. You don’t want to be without oil for even a second. So obviously, the market is preparing for a potential disruption.” 
“The market is not expecting that what we have right now is a deal,” he said.  
Merk also noted yields on Treasury bills maturing in July are starting to climb, a sign some investors and managers think the impasse in Washington may force the White House and Congress to extend the negotiations past June.  
Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, however, insist they don’t have any desire to prolong the negotiation into July or early August.

Yellen warned in a letter Monday that she may not be able to postpone the debt limit deadline without action by Congress. 
“With an additional week of information now available, I am writing to note that we estimate that is highly likely that Treasury will no longer be able to satisfy all of the government’s obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by early June, and potentially as early as June 1,” she wrote, echoing her warning to congressional leaders in other recent letters.

speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif who was narrowly elected speaker in january after 15 ballots is coming under heavy pressure from conservatives not to agree to any debt ceiling deal that falls well short of the housepassed legislation that cut 48 trillion from the deficit
so far president biden’s proposal to cap discretionary spending has fallen flat with mccarthy who wants the white house to cut discretionary spending on domestic programs without cutting defense  


  

mccarthy tried to sound optimistic about reaching a deal after meeting with biden at the white house late monday afternoon telling reporters it was a “productive” session  
“i believe we can still get there” he insisted despite the gulf of differences between the two sides on spending and policy priorities  
house freedom caucus members such as rep ralph norman rsc warn they won’t accept anything less than the housepassed bill  
that leaves mccarthy with strikingly little room to maneuver
the house bill cut discretionary spending to fiscal 2022 levels and then caps domestic discretionary spending to 1 percent growth over the next decade it also expands work requirements for federal social aid programs and rescinds 30 billion in unspent covid funding 
house republicans are also pushing for energy permitting reform measures to secure the usmexico border and to block biden’s plan to forgive 400 billion in student debt relief  


  

biden is holding fast against many of the republican demands which democrats warn would hurt american families across the nation by cutting an array of federal programs expecting mccarthy will back down  
the president also is insisting wealthy companies and individuals contribute pay more in taxes as part of any deficitreduction deal
“here’s the disagreement we have toi think we should be looking at tax loopholes and making sure the wealthy pay their fair share i think revenue matters as well asas long as you’re not taxing anybody under 400000” biden told reporters in the oval office at the start of his meeting with mccarthy 


  

sen rick scott rfla who has met regularly with house conservatives this year to call for ambitious fiscal reforms says biden is used to republican leaders “caving” on the debt limit but he says this time will be different  
“i think he’s being conditioned” scott said of biden’s stance on cutting a debt limit deal with mccarthy  
“think about it mcconnell caved in 2021” he added in an interview with the hill referring to the deal sen mitch mcconnell rky offered democrats to let them move debt limit legislation without having to face a republican filibuster  


  

“i don’t believe the house republicans are going to cave and i don’t think senate republicans are going to cave this time” he said  
scott said the tax increases white house officials are pushing to include in a deficitreduction deal would be a nonstarter with republicans in both chambers  
“it’s what i predicted” he said monday “everything i’ve heard from people is that they’re pushing it” referring to the tax reforms favored by the white house  


  

scott warned that if mccarthy agreed to any deal that includes tax increases “he could never get it done in the house” 
jim kessler the executive vice president for policy at centrist democratic think tank third way said “republicans have an unreasonable request on the table” but questioned whether mccarthy has much room to negotiate because any member of the house gop conference could call for a snap leadership election if they don’t like what comes out of the talks 
“the drama has always beencan a debt ceiling increase be passed and kevin mccarthy keep his job that’s not joe biden’s responsibility but that’s one of the chips that kevin mccarthy is playing on this” he said


  

“my expectation is they’ll get it done i think we’ll see a lot more drama” kessler added “if you’ve got a deadline of june 1 may 31 is a good day to pick as the moment when the deal is sealed that’s the way washington generally works”
rep matt gaetz rfla who initially withheld support for mccarthy’s bid to become speaker in january said the perceived threat to mccarthy’s job is overblown  
“literally nobody except the press is talking about removing mccarthy right now” he posted on twitter 


  

but he also told the washington examiner in a statement that “speaker mccarthy simply must deliver on the promises he made in january” 
former president trump who still wields a lot of influence among house republicans is urging them to force the nation into default unless democrats agree to “massive cuts” 
trump doubled down on friday when he posted on his social media platform that “republicans should not make a deal on the debt ceiling unless they get everything they want including the ‘kitchen sink’”
republicans say polls show voters agree with them on spending cuts but it’s unclear whether the white house is feeling significant pressure
an associated pressnorc center for public affairs poll of 1680 adults nationwide found 6 in 10 people surveyed say an increase in the debt limit should be linked to reforms to cut the deficit and twothirds of respondents say they are worried about the economic impact if congress fails to raise the debt limit by the june deadline  
anxiety is mounting in the financial markets as more money managers are taking precautions in case of a federal default as early as june 1 treasury secretary janet yellen again on monday warned the federal government may run out of money to pay its debts as early as that date  
axel merk the president and cio of merk investments pointed out monday that treasury bills maturing at the end of may before the debt limit deadline are yielding only 32 percent while treasuries maturing next month are yielding close to 6 percent  
he pointed out that credit default swaps hedging against a possible default or market complications associated with a default scare are “elevated”  
“there is some anxiety” merk said though he explained that traders are positioning themselves because of technical issues “tbills are the oil of the financial system they grease the wheels you don’t want to be without oil for even a second so obviously the market is preparing for a potential disruption” 
“the market is not expecting that what we have right now is a deal” he said  
merk also noted yields on treasury bills maturing in july are starting to climb a sign some investors and managers think the impasse in washington may force the white house and congress to extend the negotiations past june  
democrats and republicans on the hill however insist they don’t have any desire to prolong the negotiation into july or early august

Only half of Americans now say they are sure God exists. 
That finding, from the closely watched General Social Survey, stands out among several nuggets of new data about religion in America. 


  

Not quite 50 percent of Americans say they have no doubt about the existence of God, according to the 2022 survey, released Wednesday by NORC, the University of Chicago research organization. As recently as 2008, the share of sure-believers topped 60 percent. 
Thirty-four percent of Americans never go to church, NORC found, the highest figure recorded in five decades of surveys. 
Another new report, from the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), said that 27 percent of Americans claimed no religion in 2022, up from 19 percent in 2012 and 16 percent in 2006. 
The PRRI report tracks a historic decline in the nation’s Christian population, especially among white people. The share of Americans who identify as white evangelical Protestants has dwindled from 23 percent to 14 percent since 2006. The share of mainline white Protestants has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent. White Catholics have declined from 16 percent of the population to 13 percent. 
That is not to say Americans are not spiritual. Nearly three-quarters of people believe in life after death, NORC data show. That number has remained relatively stable over the decades.  
Only 7 percent of people do not believe in God.  


  

“Belief is very stubborn in America today,” said Ryan Burge, a political scientist at Eastern Illinois University who studies faith. 



Church membership, church attendance and belief in God all declined in the pandemic years, but the trend away from organized worship goes back generations. 
“We have a data point from the 1950s where only 3 percent of people said they had no [religious] affiliation,” said Mark Chaves, Anne Firor Scott Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Duke University. “It got up to 8 or 9 percent in the 1990s, and it’s sort of accelerated since then.” 


  

Religious scholars consider NORC the gold standard of surveys on faith. The General Social Survey found 29 percent of Americans claiming no religion in 2021, up from 23 percent in 2018 and 5 percent in 1972.  
During the pandemic 2020, the share of Americans who belonged to a church, synagogue or mosque dipped below half for possibly the first time in American history. Gallup polling had measured church membership since the Depression, when more than 70 percent of Americans belonged to some house of worship. 
Mainline Protestantism, the backbone of faith in many American communities, is “collapsing,” Burge wrote in a recent article on the decline of Baptists, Methodists and other denominations.  


  

Since the 1970s, the share of Americans who identify with Protestant denominations has declined from nearly 1 in 3 to around 1 in 10. 
Decades ago, nearly every American child was raised in some religion. Today, nearly 15 percent of the population reports no religious upbringing. 
“They’re not saying night prayers, morning prayers, taking their kids to church,” said Thomas Groome, a professor in theology and religious education at Boston College. “Whatever religion we have going forward will be by persuasion and choice and not by inherited identity.” 


  

While many religion trend lines are sinking, one key population is rising: nondenominational Protestants, or “nons,” who worship outside the mainline of Protestantism.  
The population of nons has risen from next to nothing in the 1970s to nearly 15 percent of Americans. Nondenominational Protestants “are the second-largest religious group in America today, after Catholics,” Burge said.  
Many nons attend megachurches, large congregations that have risen up outside the mainline tradition. 


  

“They might be denominational, but you wouldn’t know it,” Burge said. “A lot of these churches are called the Arc, or the Bridge.” They may not advertise their denomination. Worshippers perceive them as independent of the nation’s religious establishment. 
“We don’t like institutions, whether it be banks or unions or big business,” Burge said. “And those nondenominational churches are almost always startups. It’s a guy in his basement.” 
But the surging megachurch population is not enough to reverse the downward trend in churchgoing. On NORC surveys, nondenominational Protestants are sprinkled across two categories of religious preference, both in decline. 


  

To some extent, declining faith is a generational trend. The share of Americans who claim no religion rises with progressively younger age groups: 9 percent of the Silent Generation, 18 percent of baby boomers, 25 percent of Generation X, 29 percent of millennials and 34 percent of Generation Z, according to data from the Survey Center on American Life. 
But the rise in nonreligious Americans is too steep to be fully explained “in terms of generational replacement; that is, religious old people dying and secular young people taking their place,” said David Campbell, the Packey J. Dee Professor of American Democracy at the University of Notre Dame.  
Campbell and other scholars suspect many Americans are simply becoming more open about rejecting religion, an admission once clouded in stigma. 
“It used to be that the religiously uninvolved people, when you asked them what religion they are, they would still say, ‘Yeah, I’m Catholic, I’m Presbyterian,’ whatever,” Chaves said. Today, the same Americans are “taking the next step of saying, ‘I’m nothing.’” 
Changing societal norms may also explain why half of Americans can now say they aren’t sure there is a God.  
Stigma remains, however, around the idea of rejecting God altogether. 
The vast majority of Americans still report they believe in God without reservation, with some doubts, or at least some of the time. If not God per se, they believe in “some higher power.”  
True nonbelievers — atheists — account for only 7 percent of the population. Agnostics, who say the existence of God is unknowable, make up another 7 percent.  
Belief in God endures even among Americans who claim not to be religious: Roughly half of them believe in some sort of creator, Burge said. 
“Assuming that church attendance is the measure of faith, that notion is becoming obsolete,” Groome said. “We’ve always used church attendance as the hallmark of the faith in our people, and I don’t think they’re synonymous.” 
Faith and churchgoing remain particularly strong among Republicans. Forty-four percent of Republicans attend church at least once a week, compared to 29 percent of Democrats, Pew data shows. Most atheists are Democrats. 
But religion also remains relatively strong among Black and Hispanic Americans. Both groups are more likely than whites to attend church regularly.

“That’s a complication for the Democrats, actually,” Campbell said, because Black and Hispanic voters remain predominantly Democratic.  
Despite the steady decline in religiosity, the United States remains “a very religious country by world standards,” Chaves said.  
In one global comparison, Pew Research found 19 percent of Americans claimed no religion. The figure was higher in Germany (26 percent), Britain (31 percent), France (32 percent), China (52 percent) and Japan (60 percent), but lower in Russia (15 percent), Italy (13 percent) and India (less than 1 percent).

only half of americans now say they are sure god exists 
that finding from the closely watched general social survey stands out among several nuggets of new data about religion in america 


  

not quite 50 percent of americans say they have no doubt about the existence of god according to the 2022 survey released wednesday by norc the university of chicago research organization as recently as 2008 the share of surebelievers topped 60 percent 
thirtyfour percent of americans never go to church norc found the highest figure recorded in five decades of surveys 
another new report from the public religion research institute prri said that 27 percent of americans claimed no religion in 2022 up from 19 percent in 2012 and 16 percent in 2006 
the prri report tracks a historic decline in the nation’s christian population especially among white people the share of americans who identify as white evangelical protestants has dwindled from 23 percent to 14 percent since 2006 the share of mainline white protestants has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent white catholics have declined from 16 percent of the population to 13 percent 
that is not to say americans are not spiritual nearly threequarters of people believe in life after death norc data show that number has remained relatively stable over the decades  
only 7 percent of people do not believe in god  


  

“belief is very stubborn in america today” said ryan burge a political scientist at eastern illinois university who studies faith 



church membership church attendance and belief in god all declined in the pandemic years but the trend away from organized worship goes back generations 
“we have a data point from the 1950s where only 3 percent of people said they had no religious affiliation” said mark chaves anne firor scott distinguished professor of sociology at duke university “it got up to 8 or 9 percent in the 1990s and it’s sort of accelerated since then” 


  

religious scholars consider norc the gold standard of surveys on faith the general social survey found 29 percent of americans claiming no religion in 2021 up from 23 percent in 2018 and 5 percent in 1972  
during the pandemic 2020 the share of americans who belonged to a church synagogue or mosque dipped below half for possibly the first time in american history gallup polling had measured church membership since the depression when more than 70 percent of americans belonged to some house of worship 
mainline protestantism the backbone of faith in many american communities is “collapsing” burge wrote in a recent article on the decline of baptists methodists and other denominations  


  

since the 1970s the share of americans who identify with protestant denominations has declined from nearly 1 in 3 to around 1 in 10 
decades ago nearly every american child was raised in some religion today nearly 15 percent of the population reports no religious upbringing 
“they’re not saying night prayers morning prayers taking their kids to church” said thomas groome a professor in theology and religious education at boston college “whatever religion we have going forward will be by persuasion and choice and not by inherited identity” 


  

while many religion trend lines are sinking one key population is rising nondenominational protestants or “nons” who worship outside the mainline of protestantism  
the population of nons has risen from next to nothing in the 1970s to nearly 15 percent of americans nondenominational protestants “are the secondlargest religious group in america today after catholics” burge said  
many nons attend megachurches large congregations that have risen up outside the mainline tradition 


  

“they might be denominational but you wouldn’t know it” burge said “a lot of these churches are called the arc or the bridge” they may not advertise their denomination worshippers perceive them as independent of the nation’s religious establishment 
“we don’t like institutions whether it be banks or unions or big business” burge said “and those nondenominational churches are almost always startups it’s a guy in his basement” 
but the surging megachurch population is not enough to reverse the downward trend in churchgoing on norc surveys nondenominational protestants are sprinkled across two categories of religious preference both in decline 


  

to some extent declining faith is a generational trend the share of americans who claim no religion rises with progressively younger age groups 9 percent of the silent generation 18 percent of baby boomers 25 percent of generation x 29 percent of millennials and 34 percent of generation z according to data from the survey center on american life 
but the rise in nonreligious americans is too steep to be fully explained “in terms of generational replacement that is religious old people dying and secular young people taking their place” said david campbell the packey j dee professor of american democracy at the university of notre dame  
campbell and other scholars suspect many americans are simply becoming more open about rejecting religion an admission once clouded in stigma 
“it used to be that the religiously uninvolved people when you asked them what religion they are they would still say ‘yeah i’m catholic i’m presbyterian’ whatever” chaves said today the same americans are “taking the next step of saying ‘i’m nothing’” 
changing societal norms may also explain why half of americans can now say they aren’t sure there is a god  
stigma remains however around the idea of rejecting god altogether 
the vast majority of americans still report they believe in god without reservation with some doubts or at least some of the time if not god per se they believe in “some higher power”  
true nonbelieversatheistsaccount for only 7 percent of the population agnostics who say the existence of god is unknowable make up another 7 percent  
belief in god endures even among americans who claim not to be religious roughly half of them believe in some sort of creator burge said 
“assuming that church attendance is the measure of faith that notion is becoming obsolete” groome said “we’ve always used church attendance as the hallmark of the faith in our people and i don’t think they’re synonymous” 
faith and churchgoing remain particularly strong among republicans fortyfour percent of republicans attend church at least once a week compared to 29 percent of democrats pew data shows most atheists are democrats 
but religion also remains relatively strong among black and hispanic americans both groups are more likely than whites to attend church regularly  


		americans’ confidence in science dropped in 2022 survey	

		former trump advisor questions ‘who would work for trump’ after attacks on former staffers	

“that’s a complication for the democrats actually” campbell said because black and hispanic voters remain predominantly democratic  
despite the steady decline in religiosity the united states remains “a very religious country by world standards” chaves said  
in one global comparison pew research found 19 percent of americans claimed no religion the figure was higher in germany 26 percent britain 31 percent france 32 percent china 52 percent and japan 60 percent but lower in russia 15 percent italy 13 percent and india less than 1 percent

In a l… [+3415 chars]","

Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen warned lawmakers Monday that the nation will run out of funds to pay its debts by “early June, and potentially as early as June 1.”
In a letter to Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) sent a little more than an hour before the House GOP leader’s scheduled White House meeting with President Biden to discuss the debt ceiling, Yellen offered little new information on a deadline, saying early June remained the deadline for Congress to take action. 


  

“In my May 15 letter, I noted that our best estimate was that Treasury would be unable to continue to satisfy all of the government’s obligations by early June if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time,” she wrote. 
“In that letter, I also noted that while it is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date when Treasury will be unable to pay all the government’s bills, I would continue to update Congress as more information becomes available. With an additional week of information now available, I am writing to note that we estimate that it is highly likely that Treasury will no longer be able to satisfy all of the government’s obligations if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by early June, and potentially as early as June 1,” Yellen concluded. 
It’s the latest notice from Yellen warning the nation risks defaulting as soon as the start of June and putting pressure on lawmakers to move quickly. 
There has been some skepticism among Republicans as to whether June 1 is the actual “X-date” but McCarthy has pointed to it when discussing the potential timeline for Congress to pass a debt limit increase.
“They decide when that date is,” McCarthy told reporters on Monday. “The president may have more information on that, but she has been very clear.”

		Yellen warns of catastrophic default: ‘Time is running out’	


The notice comes as projections released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have also warned the nation risks defaulting on its debt early next month.


  

McCarthy had previously hoped negotiators could strike a deal in principle this past weekend, while eyeing a floor vote this week. But Republicans are demanding spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, and the two sides are far apart on a number of sticking points.  
“I think the Senate could probably act faster than I thought in the past,” McCarthy said. “But we’re going to need a couple of days to write it and to make sure that everyone’s able to read it and vote on it.”
Markets have begun to show some unease as Washington moves closer to the June 1 deadline. 


  

Yellen’s new warning again suggests that the government will run out of the ability to pay all its bills as early as next week, which could force a default or the inability of the government to make certain payments. 
“We have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the United States,” Yellen wrote. 
“If Congress fails to increase the debt limit, it would cause severe hardship to American families, harm our global leadership position, and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests,” she continued. 


  

“I continue to urge Congress to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by acting as soon as possible.”

A Russian revolutionary group opposed to Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed to have liberated a town in Russia near the border with Ukraine.
The rebel faction, the Freedom of Russia Legion, said it had liberated the town of Kozinka in the Belgorod region and its forces were now entering the town of Grayvoron along with another resistance group called the Russian Volunteer Corps.


  

The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said in a Telegram post that a Ukrainian “sabotage” group had entered the town of Grayvoron.
Gladkov said Russian forces, along with the National Guard and the Federal Security Service, were all working to “eliminate the enemy.”
Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communication and Information Security said the fighters in Belgorod are Russian resistance groups but welcomed their “resolute actions of the opposition against the criminal and aggressive Putin regime.”
“After the victory of Ukraine, the ‘security zone’ will be one of the key issues during the negotiations on the future coexistence with Russia,” a tweet from the center’s account reads. “Ukraine will demand the creation of a demilitarized security zone in the Russian regions bordering our state.”
The Freedom of Russia Legion also posted a statement Monday saying they were Russians who “no longer wanted to justify the actions of criminals in power” and are now taking “up arms to defend our and your freedom.”
In a video going viral online, the group lambasted the Kremlin and Putin’s regime, accusing Russian leaders of widespread corruption.


  

“We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people,” an unidentified resistance soldier says in the video, according to a Ukrainian official’s translation. “But that has no place in today’s Putin’s Russia, rotten to the core with lies, censorship, restrictions on freedom.”
The group also warned Belgorod residents to “stay at home” as they move through the region.
“Do not resist and do not be afraid: we are not your enemies,” the group wrote on Telegram. “Unlike Putin’s zombies, we do not touch civilians and do not use them for our own purposes. Freedom is near!”


  

The Freedom of Russia Legion was formed last year, consisting of defecting Russians who took up arms against their home country to help defend Ukraine.
The group is part of an international coalition of fighters assisting Ukraine as freelancers, including Americans, Belarusians and Georgians.
The Russian Volunteer Corps is a far-right militia formed in August of last year to combat Putin and is based in Ukraine.

Earlier Monday, Russia claimed the capture of the eastern city of Bakhmut, after about six months of brutal fighting.
Ukraine has aggressively denied claims of a Russian victory in Bakhmut, though they acknowledge controlling only a small part of the city.
Russian military blogger Rybar claimed the armed militants in Belgorod were “shifting the focus of attention from the loss of Bakhmut to the capture of one and a half villages on the outskirts of the Belgorod region.”

The health insurance of 600,000 Americans is hanging in the balance as part of last-minute negotiations to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.
House Republicans are pushing to include beefed-up work requirements for recipients of federal welfare — now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid as part of a debt ceiling deal with the White House.


  

“We can’t be spending more money next year. We have to spend less than we spent the year before. It’s pretty easy,” Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Friday.
Under the GOP proposal, 600,000 Americans — mostly low- and moderate-income people who are capable of working and are between 19 and 56 years old — would lose their health care after being kicked out of federal Medicaid funding, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis from April.
That would save the government $109 billion over the next decade, the CBO estimated, which is just a fraction of the $32 trillion in federal debt amassed by Republican- and Democratic-led administrations.
The White House had repeatedly written off raising the debt ceiling as nonnegotiable before giving in to Republican demands for talks ahead of a potential June 1 run-out-of-money date.
There’s a good chance the people who are about to lose Medicaid coverage, welfare, or SNAP benefits won’t even know they’ve been booted out of these federal programs until it’s too late.
Arkansas approved work requirements for Medicaid in 2017, resulting in tens of thousands of people losing coverage. Legal Aid of Arkansas attorney Trevor Hawkins started canvassing his state to let people know their lives were about to change. 


  

He told The Hill the people he met on the road had no idea what was coming.
“Most people didn’t realize these work requirements were a thing until they started getting notices that there were problems,” he said. “They were getting marks of not complying, but it was just because they didn’t know about it.”
“I literally traveled the whole state, talking to people in libraries, gas stations, barber shops — you name it. I spread flyers all across the state,” he said. “It was a hard time on me personally, just kind of seeing how this was affecting people, doing everything I could to try to spread the word.”


  

Treda Robinson, a working Arkansas resident who nearly lost her health insurance because of the work requirement law and ended up bringing a lawsuit against the state, said she would have died if she’d lost her coverage because she had a tumor she needed to have removed that was associated with her anemia.
“I would have died. The tumor was causing me to bleed, and it was making my blood count really low,” she told The Hill in an interview. “If I had lost my insurance at that time, how was I going to be able to go to the doctor to even know what was going on with me? Those appointments were $300 and $400 alone.”
Arkansas’s work requirements officially dropped around 18,000 people from their health insurance, but that number is likely significantly higher due to the selective way the state actually tracks the numbers, Hawkins said.


  

However many people ended up losing coverage in Arkansas, the total amounts to just a fraction of the number of people who will lose coverage on the national level.
While Republicans and some Democrats have defended work requirements as compelling people who receive government benefits to work for greater levels of remuneration, research out of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has shown that in practice, the requirements in Arkansas did not promote employment.
“Work requirements did not increase employment over eighteen months of follow-up,” the researchers concluded, adding that “awareness of the work requirements remained poor, with more than 70 percent of Arkansans unsure whether the policy was in effect.”


  

The proposed law is viewed by many researchers as simply a mechanism by which to remove people from government programs and not as a way to encourage people to earn a wage. 
As such, the requirements should not be thought of as a “work requirement” so much as a “paperwork requirement,” they say.
“If the goal is to get people who can work into work, the way that this goes about that is saying, ‘Prove it.’ That’s very different from checking on them using the excellent administrative data that many state governments already have,” said Kathryn Anne Edwards, an economist and public policy analyst, in an interview with The Hill.


  

“It puts the burden of proof on them, and one result that we know this will have is that a lot of people will lose benefits,” Edwards said.
This could be a good outcome if the onerous paperwork prompts Medicaid recipients to find a high-earning job that then makes them ineligible for the program.
“But that is a very rosy picture that we don’t have any evidence to support,” Edwards said. “Instead, it results in people losing benefits.”


  

The GOP legislation passed in the House does “whenever possible, prioritize the utilization of existing databases or other verification measures” over formally reported work requirements, but experts say this language has little chance of being realized practically.
“Outside of substantial efforts to regularize federal databases to be able to talk to each other, work requirements are going to continue to function as they have in the past,” said Matt Darling, an employment policy fellow at the Niskanen Center, a Washington think tank.
Work requirements, Darling said, are a “program that fails to get people into work while dropping people from Medicaid if they do not fill out the paperwork.”
The Republican targeting of welfare and national health insurance programs comes in the wake of massive tax cut packages passed during the past two Republican administrations that added substantially to the U.S. deficit.
Following the cancellation of the expanded child tax credit in 2022, which lifted millions of American children out of poverty, policy analysts are more frequently noting the lack of political consequences for targeting programs that are geared toward poor and lower-income Americans.
“The poverty rate has remained essentially unchanged for the past 40 years, so I don’t know if [targeting the poor] is necessarily a bad political strategy,” Edwards said. 
“It’s not like I can say that there are a lot of bad political outcomes for people who don’t help poor people. We do it all the time.” 
Despite regularly arguing a default on U.S. debt would result in an economic catastrophe, the Biden administration hasn’t seriously pursued any legal workarounds.

While progressive Democratic lawmakers are urging Biden to surmount Republican demands for cuts to programs that help low-income Americans, the White House has so far stuck to negotiations with House Republicans.
Such alternatives include proposals to mint additional currency for the express purpose of canceling or reducing the U.S. debt level below its current maximum level. 
Biden has expressed a willingness to invoke the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, but U.S. courts and global financial markets may not accept such workarounds.

House Republicans are canceling this week’s markup sessions for fiscal 2024 government funding bills, as debt limit talks heat up between the White House and GOP leadership.
“Given recent developments in the negotiations between Speaker McCarthy and the President, and in order to give the Speaker maximum flexibility as talks continue, the Committee will postpone this week’s markups,” House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Kay Granger (R-Texas) said in a statement. 


  

The GOP-led Appropriations Committee had previously been set to meet Tuesday morning to hold markups for the fiscal 2024 military construction, veterans affairs and legislative branch bills. 
They also had markups scheduled for the following day on fiscal 2024 homeland security and agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration bills.
Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.), top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, criticized the cancellations in a statement Tuesday. 
“The four bills we were supposed to markup this week were the ‘easy ones,’ cherry-picked so House Republicans did not have to reveal to the American people their plan to pull teachers out of kids’ classrooms and law enforcement off local streets or make our airports and communities less safe,” she said. 
Last month, House Republicans passed spending limits Democrats remain strongly opposed to.  
As part of the measure — the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 — Republicans proposed capping federal funding hashed out by lawmakers as part of the annual appropriations process at fiscal 2022 levels, while limiting annual spending growth to one percent.


  

Republicans have also pushed for the spending caps as part of a larger negotiation with the White House to raise the debt ceiling, which puts a limit on how much the debt the government can owe on to pay the country’s bills, as the threat of a federal default looms.

Democrats have fiercely opposed the proposed caps, arguing the limits could have serious consequences for domestic programs. And it remains unclear how exactly Republicans plan to exact cuts to bring spending below current levels. 
Although Democrats have needled the four spending bills introduced by Republicans for reductions in certain areas and partisan proposals, there is suspense around Capitol Hill as to what the House GOP’s proposed roadmap to cut spending will be, with more funding bills coming down the pike in the weeks ahead.

Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) issued what he described as a “formal travel advisory for socialists visiting Florida,” on Tuesday, warning that the state was “openly hostile” to socialists and their enablers.
“The state of Florida devalues and marginalizes the contributions of, and the challenges faced by Socialists and others who work in the Biden Administration,” Scott, who is also the state’s former governor, said in a press release.


  

“Let me be clear – any attempts to spread the oppression and poverty that Socialism always brings will be rebuffed by the people of Florida,” he added. “Travelers should be aware that attempts to spread Socialism in north Florida will fail and be met with laughter and mockery.”
Scott’s statement is a mocking response to recent travel issued by social justice groups declaring Florida an unsafe state for certain minority groups.

The League of United Latin American Citizens (a civil rights organization) and Equality Florida (an LGBTQ rights group) also issued travel warnings in recent weeks.
Scott, who has often served as a political foil to President Biden, used similar language found in the NAACP’s advisory, seeming to mock the dangers outlined by the civil right’s group by drawing parallels to Biden.
He said the counteractive travel advisory came “in direct response to the Biden Administration attempts to erase capitalism and the system that has brought prosperity to Florida and the entire United States.”

Former President Trump accused Fox News host Laura Ingraham of running a “hit piece” on him for airing a segment focusing on his poll numbers compared to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who is expected to announce a White House bid in the coming days.
Trump, minutes after the segment aired Monday evening, took to his Truth Social website to blast the longtime conservative commentator, who has been largely supportive of him in recent years. 


  

“Laura Ingraham on FoxNews just did a hit piece on me (there go her ratings!) showing some polls which indicate that Ron DeSanctimonious may do better against Biden than I would, when actually polls show that I do MUCH better against Biden than ‘Rob,'” Trump wrote. 
“The poll your looking at now, which has me doing far better against Crooked Joe, was just put out by FOX, I am sure unhappily,” Trump continued. “I’m also leading DeSanctus by over 40 points in Primary Voting. Watch Greg Kelly on Newsmax at 10:00 P.M.”

During the segment, Ingraham hosted conservative author and pundit Chris Bedford, who serves as executive editor of Common Sense Society, and the two discussed how Trump’s poll numbers match up against President Biden and DeSantis in states Trump narrowly lost during the 2020 election. 
“Joe Biden is running pretty badly behind a generic Republican figure like a Ron DeSantis or Tim Scott,” Bedford said, referring to the GOP senator from South Carolina who announced his White House bid on Monday. “But he’s consistently beating Donald Trump.” 
Ingraham noted the economy and immigration are two of the key issues voters have indicated are most important to them in the 2024 election, before suggesting leading national Republicans are coming up short in addressing those concerns. 


  

Trump’s public criticism of Fox is nothing new. The former president has relentlessly attacked top hosts and leaders at the network in recent weeks over its coverage of DeSantis and other issues, in one recent rebuke calling Fox the “RINO” network, a pejorative term meaning Republican in name only.

During an interview with The Hill last fall, Ingraham deflected a question about whether Republicans should support Trump or DeSantis, saying instead the party should focus on populist messaging regardless of who the GOP candidate in 2024 ends up being. 
Tensions between Fox and Trump have grown more intense in the weeks following the company’s recently settled defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over the former president’s claims about the voting system company’s software. 


  

Fox last month ousted Tucker Carlson, its top-rated prime-time host who was vocally supportive of Trump on his show, a move that has enraged some conservatives within the former president’s base.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Monday that he’s open to the idea of freezing spending at current levels in order to secure a debt ceiling deal — an idea supported by President Biden but sure to infuriate liberals in Jeffries’s own Democratic Caucus.
“As part of the effort to find common ground, we’re willing to consider freezing spending,” Jeffries told reporters outside the Capitol. “That is not an extreme proposal. That is a reasonable proposal.”


  

Amid the talks with Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the White House has offered Republicans a freeze in federal spending at current, fiscal 2023 levels — a proposal McCarthy has rejected.
“A freeze is not less; a freeze is spending the same amount,” McCarthy said Monday evening, shortly after he met with Biden at the White House to continue negotiations.
The spending caps have emerged as a central sticking point in the high-stakes discussions about raising the debt ceiling and preventing a government default, which the Treasury Department has warned could happen as soon as June 1.
Behind McCarthy, Republicans are insisting on steep spending cuts as a condition of raising the debt ceiling, leveraging the threat of default to pressure Biden to accept their terms.
House Republicans had passed a debt ceiling package last month that would cut fiscal 2024 spending back to fiscal 2022 levels — a decrease estimated to be roughly $130 billion below the 2023 levels. They’re noting that the 2022 spending levels were in place as recently as December, when Congress passed a massive government funding bill establishing the current 2023 levels.
“It was not a big cut; it was the same money we were spending five months ago,” said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), head of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, whose members have warned that they won’t except a watered-down version of the House-passed bill.


  

“What we’re willing to accept is what we passed last month,” Perry added. “That’s why we passed it.”
Highlighting the perils facing Democratic leaders, a number of liberals are fighting to hike federal spending, warning that cuts would harm programs that benefit the most vulnerable populations.  
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a staunch liberal, praised Biden on Monday for pushing back against what she characterized as the “some of the extreme demands” from Republicans. But she also warned that there are limits to how far Biden can compromise, and accepting cuts is “going to be a problem” with progressives.


  

“We do not negotiate through the debt ceiling for this very reason,” she said.

Jeffries acknowledged the unpopularity of the spending freeze, which Democrats have characterized as a cut when inflation is factored in. But he suggested he’s willing to accept it anyway, as a concession to the Republicans who control the House.
“Any proposal that potentially offers to freeze spending is not a proposal that has been put into the public domain by the left flank,” Jeffries said. “That’s an inherently reasonable effort to find common ground in a divided government situation.”


  

McCarthy and Biden reached no agreement during their White House meeting Monday. But McCarthy said the sides have moved “closer” to a deal and staff-level negotiations are expected to continue into Monday night.

The prevailing account says Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is walking a tightrope over a shark tank in the debt ceiling talks, sidling precariously between a federal default on one side and the loss of his Speakership on the other.
The prevailing account might have it all wrong.


  

As McCarthy and President Biden race to find common ground on extending the government’s borrowing authority, the Speaker has defied the doubts that came with his arduous path to the gavel, building up trust among his conservative naysayers and creating what appears to be a comfortable space to battle Biden over the terms of the debt ceiling hike.
McCarthy has dragged Biden to the negotiating table, which the president resisted for months. He’s taken any tax hikes — which Democrats have demanded in past debt limit fights — off the table. And the Speaker’s success last month in shepherding a Republican debt-ceiling package through the House — despite a tiny GOP majority — has buoyed even some of his fiercest conservative detractors.

Those conservatives say they’re not eyeing an effort to strip McCarthy of his gavel, even if they oppose an eventual compromise with Biden.
“Nobody’s talking about that,” Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.) recently told MSNBC. “We support our Speaker. We want him to be successful because the country needs for him to be successful.”
“Literally nobody except the press is talking about removing McCarthy right now,” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) echoed Monday on Twitter. 


  

Those dynamics could set the stage for a compromise that looks a lot like the debt ceiling deals of years past, when liberals rejected the legislation for cutting too much spending, conservatives opposed it for not cutting enough — and some motley combination of moderates and leadership allies in both parties came together to approve the bill and prevent a default.
“The mechanics of getting there we’re very in tuned with,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), one of the Republicans leading the talks with the White House.

McCarthy is not blind to those dynamics, acknowledging Monday that House Republicans were never going to get everything they wanted, given the Democrats’ control of the White House and Senate — the same divided powers that governed similar debt ceiling battles between former President Obama and then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), and more recently between former President Trump and then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).


  

“It happens every single time,” McCarthy told reporters in the Capitol shortly before a meeting with Biden at the White House. “That’s what divided government does.”
Yet McCarthy’s challenge is not merely in negotiating a bipartisan compromise, it’s also in putting a bill on the House floor that can win Biden’s support without angering conservatives to such an extent that they seek to boot the Speaker from power.
“The skepticism of McCarthy specifically has been hanging in the air for a long time now, and sort of is a dark cloud over the proceedings this time around,” said Philip Wallach, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 


  

“It’s easy to imagine that dissipating, and Kevin McCarthy showing that once again, the doubters are going to realize that he’s capable of more than they imagined,” he continued. “But it’s also just as easy to imagine things becoming very tricky if Republicans start really tearing each other to pieces.”

McCarthy has dismissed the idea of an internal GOP revolt, predicting he can negotiate a deal that both avoids a default and wins at least half of his conservative-heavy conference — a stipulation known informally as the Hastert Rule.


  

“I firmly believe what we’re negotiating right now a majority of Republicans will see that it … [will] put us on the right path,” he said Monday. 
Still, the removal process was made easier by the rule changes McCarthy agreed to in January as a condition of gaining enough conservative support to win the gavel — changes that allow a single lawmaker to launch the process of vacating the Speaker’s chair. And Democrats aren’t so sure McCarthy would stage a vote on a bipartisan debt ceiling bill if his seat is on the line. 
“That’s the big unknown,” said Rep. John B. Larson (D-Conn.), a 25-year veteran of Capitol Hill, noting that the threat to vacate the Speakership is more explicit this year than in those of the past. “Were that not the case, were that Paul Ryan or John Boehner, you would be able to say, ‘OK, I can pretty much figure out how that will play [out].’ But this is an unknown that we haven’t had before.”

Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was even more skeptical. 
“If Kevin McCarthy is forced to choose between holding power in his Speakership, or taking us closer to default, we know he’s going to choose default,” Aguilar told reporters earlier in the month.
Still, Democratic leaders will have their own challenges in the debate, since any compromise will necessarily feature some of the spending cuts and other policy changes Republicans are demanding. 


  

Indeed, Biden has already signaled an openness to a spending freeze for 2024, permitting reforms to expedite energy projects and an expansion of work requirements for some social benefit programs. All of those provisions are opposed by liberals in Congress, and their inclusion will test the ability of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the newly installed Democratic leader, to rally his members in support of their White House ally. 

Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) speaks to reporters alongside Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) following a House Democratic Caucus meeting on Wednesday, May 10, 2023.
Democratic support will be crucial to the bill’s success, because a number of conservatives say they won’t vote for anything less than the House GOP bill. And Democrats are already warning that their support will have limits, too. 
“Let’s face it, the majority of votes to pass this in the House is going to come from the Democratic side. So we can’t have a deal that is so weighted toward Republican priorities on policy, and yet when it comes to the votes, it’s the House Democrats who are expected to do the heavy lifting,” Rep. Brendan Boyle (Pa.), senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee, told CNN on Sunday night. 
“That, frankly, is just not going to happen.”
McCarthy’s conservative detractors have given the Speaker high marks throughout the debate while putting pressure on him to hold his ground. But even so, “I haven’t heard anybody talking about motion to vacate except for reporters who asked me about that,” Good told The Hill. 
Additionally, any conservative effort to topple McCarthy would necessarily require the support of virtually all of the minority Democrats, since the Speaker would likely be backed by the overwhelming majority of his GOP conference — a step many Democrats say they simply wouldn’t take.
“I don’t think there is interest on the part of Democrats to fuel the uncertainty and the chaos,” said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.). “That doesn’t help any of us.”

the prevailing account says speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif is walking a tightrope over a shark tank in the debt ceiling talks sidling precariously between a federal default on one side and the loss of his speakership on the other
the prevailing account might have it all wrong


  

as mccarthy and president biden race to find common ground on extending the government’s borrowing authority the speaker has defied the doubts that came with his arduous path to the gavel building up trust among his conservative naysayers and creating what appears to be a comfortable space to battle biden over the terms of the debt ceiling hike
mccarthy has dragged biden to the negotiating table which the president resisted for months he’s taken any tax hikes — which democrats have demanded in past debt limit fights — off the table and the speaker’s success last month in shepherding a republican debtceiling package through the housedespite a tiny gop majorityhas buoyed even some of his fiercest conservative detractors

speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif addresses reporters after he returns from a closeddoor house republican conference meeting at the capitol hill club in washington dc on tuesday may 23 2023 greg nash
those conservatives say they’re not eyeing an effort to strip mccarthy of his gavel even if they oppose an eventual compromise with biden
“nobody’s talking about that” rep bob good rva recently told msnbc “we support our speaker we want him to be successful because the country needs for him to be successful”
“literally nobody except the press is talking about removing mccarthy right now” rep matt gaetz rfla echoed monday on twitter 


  

those dynamics could set the stage for a compromise that looks a lot like the debt ceiling deals of years past when liberals rejected the legislation for cutting too much spending conservatives opposed it for not cutting enoughand some motley combination of moderates and leadership allies in both parties came together to approve the bill and prevent a default
“the mechanics of getting there we’re very in tuned with” said rep patrick mchenry rnc one of the republicans leading the talks with the white house

mccarthy is not blind to those dynamics acknowledging monday that house republicans were never going to get everything they wanted given the democrats’ control of the white house and senatethe same divided powers that governed similar debt ceiling battles between former president obama and thenspeaker john boehner rohio and more recently between former president trump and thenspeaker nancy pelosi dcalif


  

“it happens every single time” mccarthy told reporters in the capitol shortly before a meeting with biden at the white house “that’s what divided government does”
yet mccarthy’s challenge is not merely in negotiating a bipartisan compromise it’s also in putting a bill on the house floor that can win biden’s support without angering conservatives to such an extent that they seek to boot the speaker from power
“the skepticism of mccarthy specifically has been hanging in the air for a long time now and sort of is a dark cloud over the proceedings this time around” said philip wallach senior fellow at the american enterprise institute 


  

“it’s easy to imagine that dissipating and kevin mccarthy showing that once again the doubters are going to realize that he’s capable of more than they imagined” he continued “but it’s also just as easy to imagine things becoming very tricky if republicans start really tearing each other to pieces”

house speaker kevin mccarthy of calif speaks as he meets with president joe biden to discuss the debt limit in the oval office of the white house monday may 22 2023 in washington ap photoalex brandon
mccarthy has dismissed the idea of an internal gop revolt predicting he can negotiate a deal that both avoids a default and wins at least half of his conservativeheavy conference — a stipulation known informally as the hastert rule


  

“i firmly believe what we’re negotiating right now a majority of republicans will see that it … will put us on the right path” he said monday 
still the removal process was made easier by the rule changes mccarthy agreed to in january as a condition of gaining enough conservative support to win the gavelchanges that allow a single lawmaker to launch the process of vacating the speaker’s chair and democrats aren’t so sure mccarthy would stage a vote on a bipartisan debt ceiling bill if his seat is on the line 
“that’s the big unknown” said rep john b larson dconn a 25year veteran of capitol hill noting that the threat to vacate the speakership is more explicit this year than in those of the past “were that not the case were that paul ryan or john boehner you would be able to say ‘ok i can pretty much figure out how that will play out’ but this is an unknown that we haven’t had before”

Lawmakers sparred with Federal Housing Finance Administration Director Sandra Thompson on Tuesday after the agency implemented controversial mortgage pricing updates critics said will punish borrowers with good credit scores.
Thompson told lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee that the updates do not penalize good-credit borrowers for the benefit of those who are less creditworthy and put up smaller down payments. 


  

Critics of the changes to loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs), including some Republican lawmakers, have argued these fees will punish responsible borrowers while encouraging others to act irresponsibly amid worsening housing affordability issues. 
They argue the agency is imposing higher fees on more creditworthy applicants so they can undercharge riskier borrowers. 
“What you’re essentially proposing or doing,” Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) told Thompson, “is taking money from those with good credit that have spent years saving for a home and transferring it to more risky borrowers.” 
“We all agree that there is a housing affordability problem in this country, but it won’t be solved by punishing those who play by the rules and did things right, and none of this will be solved by this unjust socialist-style redistribution of wealth,” she added. 
But Thompson told lawmakers misconceptions about the updated price grid are based on misleading media reports, which rely on the idea that previous pricing was somehow “perfectly aligned with risks” faced by federal mortgage purchasers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  
“I want to be very clear on one key point, and one that bears repeating: Under the new pricing framework, borrowers with strong credit profiles are not being penalized to benefit borrowers with weaker credit profiles,” Thompson told lawmakers in person Tuesday morning. 


  

“Put another way, even with reduced fees, borrowers with lower credit scores and lower down payments will continue to pay higher overall mortgage costs than borrowers with higher credit scores and higher down payments,” she added. 
Thompson said borrowers with good credit will always pay less than their peers with lower credit scores. 
New fees added upfront to a 30-year loan of $400,000 could tack on an extra $42 per month for borrowers with a credit score above 780, Freddie Mac data showed.  


  

But experts say higher credit scores will still lead to lower payments, and the new pricing adjustments are not penalizing borrowers with good credit.  
Instead, higher credit borrowers might not get as high of a break as before, while the hit on riskier borrowers with lower credit and lower down payments could be smaller. Thompson added that borrowers with smaller down payments still will pay additional mortgage insurance fees. 
Still, Republicans challenged Thompson over her assertion that the updated grid does not unfairly affect borrowers with high credit scores. Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) argued there were no price increases for borrowers with credit scores of 679 or below. 


  

“And this is the problem that members have, because our constituents have a problem with this and it may advance a political agenda of equitable housing, but it doesn’t advance the statutory mandate that you as the FHFA director have to promote safety and soundness,” Barr said.  
“So what we think you’re doing here by assessing higher fees on higher credit borrowers, is you’re actually contradicting the statutory mandate to advance safety and soundness and you’re putting taxpayers at risk,” he added. 
The committee’s ranking member, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), welcomed the agency’s changes and noted they were a move toward giving borrowers without a 20 percent down payment a shot at homeownership. 


  

Waters said her colleagues across the aisle are distorting facts about the new pricing grid, adding that the changes will help constituents across the board.

“My colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to be more concerned about protecting the wealthy, even if it comes at the expense of those with less intergenerational wealth,” Waters said. 
The FHFA recently rescinded its plan to raise mortgage fees for borrowers with a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio above 40 percent. A person’s DTI ratio is calculated by their pretax monthly expenses compared with their income.   


  

Borrowers whose DTI ratio landed higher than 40 percent would have incurred an extra 0.375 percent on a loan acquired by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

“i want to be very clear on one key point and one that bears repeating under the new pricing framework borrowers with strong credit profiles are not being penalized to benefit borrowers with weaker credit profiles” thompson told lawmakers in person tuesday morning 


  

“put another way even with reduced fees borrowers with lower credit scores and lower down payments will continue to pay higher overall mortgage costs than borrowers with higher credit scores and higher down payments” she added 
thompson said borrowers with good credit will always pay less than their peers with lower credit scores 
new fees added upfront to a 30year loan of 400000 could tack on an extra 42 per month for borrowers with a credit score above 780 freddie mac data showed  


  

but experts say higher credit scores will still lead to lower payments and the new pricing adjustments are not penalizing borrowers with good credit  
instead higher credit borrowers might not get as high of a break as before while the hit on riskier borrowers with lower credit and lower down payments could be smaller thompson added that borrowers with smaller down payments still will pay additional mortgage insurance fees 
still republicans challenged thompson over her assertion that the updated grid does not unfairly affect borrowers with high credit scores rep andy barr rky argued there were no price increases for borrowers with credit scores of 679 or below 


  

“and this is the problem that members have because our constituents have a problem with this and it may advance a political agenda of equitable housing but it doesn’t advance the statutory mandate that you as the fhfa director have to promote safety and soundness” barr said  
“so what we think you’re doing here by assessing higher fees on higher credit borrowers is you’re actually contradicting the statutory mandate to advance safety and soundness and you’re putting taxpayers at risk” he added 
the committee’s ranking member rep maxine waters dcalif welcomed the agency’s changes and noted they were a move toward giving borrowers without a 20 percent down payment a shot at homeownership 


  

waters said her colleagues across the aisle are distorting facts about the new pricing grid adding that the changes will help constituents across the board

“my colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to be more concerned about protecting the wealthy even if it comes at the expense of those with less intergenerational wealth” waters said 
the fhfa recently rescinded its plan to raise mortgage fees for borrowers with a debttoincome dti ratio above 40 percent a person’s dti ratio is calculated by their pretax monthly expenses compared with their income   


  

borrowers whose dti ratio landed higher than 40 percent would have incurred an extra 0375 percent on a loan acquired by fannie mae or freddie mac

The health insurance of 600,000 Americans is hanging in the balance as part of last-minute negotiations to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.
House Republicans are pushing to include beefed-up work requirements for recipients of federal welfare — now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid as part of a debt ceiling deal with the White House.


  

“We can’t be spending more money next year. We have to spend less than we spent the year before. It’s pretty easy,” Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Friday.
Under the GOP proposal, 600,000 Americans — mostly low- and moderate-income people who are capable of working and are between 19 and 56 years old — would lose their health care after being kicked out of federal Medicaid funding, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis from April.
That would save the government $109 billion over the next decade, the CBO estimated, which is just a fraction of the $32 trillion in federal debt amassed by Republican- and Democratic-led administrations.
The White House had repeatedly written off raising the debt ceiling as nonnegotiable before giving in to Republican demands for talks ahead of a potential June 1 run-out-of-money date.
There’s a good chance the people who are about to lose Medicaid coverage, welfare, or SNAP benefits won’t even know they’ve been booted out of these federal programs until it’s too late.
Arkansas approved work requirements for Medicaid in 2017, resulting in tens of thousands of people losing coverage. Legal Aid of Arkansas attorney Trevor Hawkins started canvassing his state to let people know their lives were about to change. 


  

He told The Hill the people he met on the road had no idea what was coming.
“Most people didn’t realize these work requirements were a thing until they started getting notices that there were problems,” he said. “They were getting marks of not complying, but it was just because they didn’t know about it.”
“I literally traveled the whole state, talking to people in libraries, gas stations, barber shops — you name it. I spread flyers all across the state,” he said. “It was a hard time on me personally, just kind of seeing how this was affecting people, doing everything I could to try to spread the word.”


  

Treda Robinson, a working Arkansas resident who nearly lost her health insurance because of the work requirement law and ended up bringing a lawsuit against the state, said she would have died if she’d lost her coverage because she had a tumor she needed to have removed that was associated with her anemia.
“I would have died. The tumor was causing me to bleed, and it was making my blood count really low,” she told The Hill in an interview. “If I had lost my insurance at that time, how was I going to be able to go to the doctor to even know what was going on with me? Those appointments were $300 and $400 alone.”
Arkansas’s work requirements officially dropped around 18,000 people from their health insurance, but that number is likely significantly higher due to the selective way the state actually tracks the numbers, Hawkins said.


  

However many people ended up losing coverage in Arkansas, the total amounts to just a fraction of the number of people who will lose coverage on the national level.
While Republicans and some Democrats have defended work requirements as compelling people who receive government benefits to work for greater levels of remuneration, research out of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has shown that in practice, the requirements in Arkansas did not promote employment.
“Work requirements did not increase employment over eighteen months of follow-up,” the researchers concluded, adding that “awareness of the work requirements remained poor, with more than 70 percent of Arkansans unsure whether the policy was in effect.”


  

The proposed law is viewed by many researchers as simply a mechanism by which to remove people from government programs and not as a way to encourage people to earn a wage. 
As such, the requirements should not be thought of as a “work requirement” so much as a “paperwork requirement,” they say.
“If the goal is to get people who can work into work, the way that this goes about that is saying, ‘Prove it.’ That’s very different from checking on them using the excellent administrative data that many state governments already have,” said Kathryn Anne Edwards, an economist and public policy analyst, in an interview with The Hill.


  

“It puts the burden of proof on them, and one result that we know this will have is that a lot of people will lose benefits,” Edwards said.
This could be a good outcome if the onerous paperwork prompts Medicaid recipients to find a high-earning job that then makes them ineligible for the program.
“But that is a very rosy picture that we don’t have any evidence to support,” Edwards said. “Instead, it results in people losing benefits.”


  

The GOP legislation passed in the House does “whenever possible, prioritize the utilization of existing databases or other verification measures” over formally reported work requirements, but experts say this language has little chance of being realized practically.
“Outside of substantial efforts to regularize federal databases to be able to talk to each other, work requirements are going to continue to function as they have in the past,” said Matt Darling, an employment policy fellow at the Niskanen Center, a Washington think tank.
Work requirements, Darling said, are a “program that fails to get people into work while dropping people from Medicaid if they do not fill out the paperwork.”
The Republican targeting of welfare and national health insurance programs comes in the wake of massive tax cut packages passed during the past two Republican administrations that added substantially to the U.S. deficit.
Following the cancellation of the expanded child tax credit in 2022, which lifted millions of American children out of poverty, policy analysts are more frequently noting the lack of political consequences for targeting programs that are geared toward poor and lower-income Americans.
“The poverty rate has remained essentially unchanged for the past 40 years, so I don’t know if [targeting the poor] is necessarily a bad political strategy,” Edwards said. 
“It’s not like I can say that there are a lot of bad political outcomes for people who don’t help poor people. We do it all the time.” 
Despite regularly arguing a default on U.S. debt would result in an economic catastrophe, the Biden administration hasn’t seriously pursued any legal workarounds.

		Despite widespread protest, Reddit CEO says company is ‘not negotiating’ on 3rd-party app charges	

While progressive Democratic lawmakers are urging Biden to surmount Republican demands for cuts to programs that help low-income Americans, the White House has so far stuck to negotiations with House Republicans.
Such alternatives include proposals to mint additional currency for the express purpose of canceling or reducing the U.S. debt level below its current maximum level. 
Biden has expressed a willingness to invoke the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, but U.S. courts and global financial markets may not accept such workarounds.

Former Trump White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said Monday that invoking the 14th Amendment to avert a federal default would do more harm than good.
In an interview with NewsNation’s “The Hill,” Mulvaney said the likely interest rate spike and legal uncertainty to follow a 14th Amendment maneuver would damage the economy.


  

“It doesn’t really solve the problem,” Mulvaney said. “There’s a lot of good conversations going on. I don’t really think the 14th Amendment is going to get either side very far very quickly.”
President Biden has said he would reluctantly invoke the 14th Amendment — which declares that the U.S. debt “shall not be questioned” — if he’s unable to reach a deal with Republicans to raise or suspend the debt ceiling.
Progressive Democrats are ramping up pressure on Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment and circumvent Republican demands. But doing so would be an unprecedented test of constitutional law that could send tremors through financial markets, according to legal and financial experts.
Mulvaney said that borrowing costs would likely spike as investors loose faith in the ability of the U.S. to pay its debts. A jump in interest rates could slow the economy into a deep recession, particularly after the Federal Reserve’s rapid run of rate hikes.

“If you try something here at the last minute that’s untested, legally in the courts, who’s going to give you low interest rates for that? If I lend you money on an untested piece of debt, I’m gonna want a much much higher interest rate because it might be illegal to do so,” Mulvaney said.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Monday that the U.S. would “very likely” default in early June and as soon as June 1.


  

Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) held a roughly hourlong meeting with Biden on the debt ceiling Monday night. He said the latest conversation was “productive,” but that the two sides still don’t have an agreement on how to avoid default.

The depth and breadth of the looming legal problems facing former President Trump are on full display this week after a rapid series of developments in various cases.
In the past few days alone, one of Trump’s top lawyers departed, citing internal friction, the special counsel has intensified his investigation into the former president’s conduct and writer E. Jean Carroll has filed for more damages after Trump mocked her sexual assault allegations at a CNN town hall.


  

Meanwhile, a New York judge called a hearing Tuesday to reiterate to Trump that rules surrounding his hush money prosecution bar him from using evidence in the case to attack any witnesses.
The specter of legal trouble is nothing new for Trump. Jack Smith, a Justice Department special counsel, is investigating his handling of classified information and his efforts to remain in power after the 2020 election. A Georgia prosecutor is probing attempts to overturn the state’s election results in 2020.

Trump was indicted earlier this year on charges related to an alleged hush money scheme to keep an affair quiet during the 2016 campaign, and he was recently found liable for defamation and sexual abuse of Carroll.
But the latest developments come as the 2024 GOP primary field takes shape, with Trump’s chief rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), set to enter the race this week, just days after Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) jumped in the contest Monday. 
The steady stream of news began in recent days when Timothy Parlatore, one of Trump’s attorneys handling the document case, resigned and went public with some of his concerns about the influence of some in the former president’s inner circle.


  

“It had nothing to do with the case itself or the client,” Parlatore told CNN’s Paula Reid.
“The real reason is because there are certain individuals that made defending the president much harder than it needed to be. In particular, there is one individual who works for him, Boris Epshteyn, who had really done everything he could to try to block us — to prevent us from doing what we could to defend the president.”

Parlatore said Epshteyn “served as kind of a filter to prevent us from getting information to the client. … In my opinion, he was not very honest with us or with the client on certain things.”


  

That includes major events in the case, including subsequent searches of Trump properties to assure there were no remaining classified records on the premises. 
“There were certain things, like the searches, that he attempted to interfere with,” Parlatore said.
Smith’s case against Trump, especially on the Mar-a-Lago front, appears to be accelerating. 


  

Parlatore told The Hill last week that Smith appeared to be wrapping up his presentation to the grand jury assembled in the case.
“I think that they’re just about done with all the grand jury witnesses at this point. And moving into the report writing phase,” he said. 
“I think that they’re going to spend the next month writing up a several-hundred-page report …and present it to [Attorney General Merrick Garland in the] beginning of June.”

The investigation has expanded to also include some of the Trump organization’s business dealings while the former president was still in office. 
Smith issued a subpoena for records of business deals that former President Trump’s company made with seven countries since he took office in 2017: China, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.


  

In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis signaled in recent days that charges in her investigation could come in early August. That case is focused on a “fake electors” scheme hatched by Trump allies after the 2020 election.
As those investigations play out, others are already expected to follow him into presidential primary season next spring. 
Attorneys for Carroll on Monday amended a complaint to seek additional damages from Trump after he called her a “whack job” and mocked her allegation that he raped her in an encounter in the 1990s. He made the comments during a CNN town hall earlier this month, the day after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The civil case will likely loom over the former president for months to come.


  




		Trump Justice Department kept Clinton Foundation case open until last days of presidency: report	


A Manhattan judge Tuesday tentatively set the trial date for Trump’s hush money case for March 2024, which would be right in the thick of primary voting. 
Also in that case, Justice Juan Merchan agreed to a request from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) to schedule a Tuesday hearing reviewing the limitations on how the former president may use the evidence he has access to during the trial.
Merchan has said Trump will remain free to speak about the “vast majority of the evidence” but that he may not directly post evidence to social media nor reveal information about witnesses involved in the case. He is also only allowed to review evidence in the presence of his attorneys.
Trump lashed out at the decision Tuesday.
“Just had New York County Supreme Court hearing where I believe my First Amendment Rights, “Freedom of Speech,” have been violated, and they forced upon us a trial date of March 25th, right in the middle of Primary season. Very unfair, but this is exactly what the Radical Left Democrats wanted. It’s called ELECTION INTERFERENCE, and nothing like this has ever happened in our Country before!!!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media site.
So far, the myriad controversies have yet to seriously harm Trump politically in the GOP race.
The former president’s polling lead has expanded since he was indicted last month in the hush money case, and his team of advisers believe he benefited from the CNN town hall, despite the potential legal implications of his comments about Carroll and classified documents he’d taken with him to his Mar-a-Lago estate.
A RealClearPolitics average of recent GOP primary polls shows Trump with a comfortable 37-percentage-point lead over DeSantis, who is polling in second place in most surveys.
“Great Poll Numbers, but the Communists are after me. Can’t let them succeed. MAGA!” Trump wrote on Truth Social this week.

Russia’s armed forces fought for two days on Russian soil against two resistance groups opposed to President Vladimir Putin before the rebels were defeated in the Belgorod region on Tuesday.
Russian state media claimed more than 70 resistance fighters from the Free Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps were killed in Belgorod after the revolutionary groups marched into several regional towns on Monday.


  

Members of both armed resistance groups are made up of defecting Russians who have fought for Ukraine since last year against the Russian army. Moscow calls the fighters saboteurs of the Ukrainian military.
Here’s what we know about the Free Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps.
Free Russia Legion
In a video that went viral this week, a group of unidentified soldiers of the Free Russia Legion decried what they called widespread corruption in the Kremlin.
“We are Russians like you, we are people like you,” one of the group’s members said. “We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people, that they could travel, study and simply be happy in a free country. But that has no place in today’s Putin’s Russia.”
The Free Russia Legion was formed in March 2022, made up of Russians who defected from the Russian military shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, according to Radio Free Europe. 
By some estimates, there are up to 4,000 troops in the militia unit.


  

One Russian soldier with the resistance group, who goes by the call sign Caesar, has made multiple public statements on behalf of the Free Russia Legion.
Caesar said there were just two soldiers of the Free Russia Legion who died in the fighting and claimed the raid was successful, with fighters taking equipment and prisoners. The Hill has not been able to independently verify casualty estimates.
Caesar hinted the militia group would take action against Russia in the future. 


  

“We will not betray the idea of a Free Russia, the hope of Russians, we will return truth and justice to Russia,” Caesar said in a statement posted to Telegram.
Russian Volunteer Corps
The Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK) is a more radical group made up of far-right Russian extremists.
Formed in August 2022 by Denis Kapustin, the paramilitary unit is pushing to overthrow Putin and Russian elites.


  

Kapustin, who also goes by the pseudonym Denis Nikitin, is a Russian citizen and far-right extremist who has organized fighting rings and tournaments across Europe. 
The European Union banned Kapustin in 2019 for his neo-Nazi activism, citing him as a public safety threat, according to several European newspapers.
Before founding the RDK, Kapustin had ties with a far-right unit of Ukraine’s military, the Azov regiment.


  

The RDK took responsibility for a brief raid into Russia’s Bryansk territory in March, which Russian officials said left at least two civilians dead. 
RDK militants also claimed to have launched another small raid in Bryansk in April.
Other factions
While these groups did not march into Russian territory, there is an international coalition of fighters in Ukraine. 


  

A few hundred Belarusians have coalesced into a unit called the Kastus Kalinouski regiment that has been fighting for Ukraine since last year. 
Those fighters are also acting in opposition to Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin.

Georgians have been fighting for Kyiv since 2014, when Russian-backed separatists launched an armed rebellion in eastern Ukraine, in a regiment called the Georgian National Legion.


  

Other fighters from nations across the world have entered the fight against Russia with Ukraine’s International Legion.
These soldiers have joined the fray without the official backing of their government, including those from the U.S., Canada and countries in western Europe.

free russia legion
in a video that went viral this week a group of unidentified soldiers of the free russia legion decried what they called widespread corruption in the kremlin
“we are russians like you we are people like you” one of the group’s members said “we want our children to grow up in peace and be free people that they could travel study and simply be happy in a free country but that has no place in today’s putin’s russia”
the free russia legion was formed in march 2022 made up of russians who defected from the russian military shortly after the invasion of ukraine according to radio free europe 
by some estimates there are up to 4000 troops in the militia unit


  

one russian soldier with the resistance group who goes by the call sign caesar has made multiple public statements on behalf of the free russia legion
caesar said there were just two soldiers of the free russia legion who died in the fighting and claimed the raid was successful with fighters taking equipment and prisoners the hill has not been able to independently verify casualty estimates
caesar hinted the militia group would take action against russia in the future 


  

“we will not betray the idea of a free russia the hope of russians we will return truth and justice to russia” caesar said in a statement posted to telegram
russian volunteer corps
the russian volunteer corps rdk is a more radical group made up of farright russian extremists
formed in august 2022 by denis kapustin the paramilitary unit is pushing to overthrow putin and russian elites


  

kapustin who also goes by the pseudonym denis nikitin is a russian citizen and farright extremist who has organized fighting rings and tournaments across europe 
the european union banned kapustin in 2019 for his neonazi activism citing him as a public safety threat according to several european newspapers
before founding the rdk kapustin had ties with a farright unit of ukraine’s military the azov regiment


  

the rdk took responsibility for a brief raid into russia’s bryansk territory in march which russian officials said left at least two civilians dead 
rdk militants also claimed to have launched another small raid in bryansk in april
other factions
while these groups did not march into russian territory there is an international coalition of fighters in ukraine 


  

a few hundred belarusians have coalesced into a unit called the kastus kalinouski regiment that has been fighting for ukraine since last year 
those fighters are also acting in opposition to belarusian president aleksander lukashenko a close ally of putin

California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Tuesday slammed Target’s chief executive for pulling LGBTQ and Pride Month merchandise from store shelves after facing backlash and threats of violence from some customers.
“CEO of Target Brian Cornell selling out the LGBTQ+ community to extremists is a real profile in courage. This isn’t just a couple stores in the South. There is a systematic attack on the gay community happening across the country,” Newsom wrote in a tweet Tuesday night. 


  

“Wake up America. This doesn’t stop here. You’re black? You’re Asian? You’re Jewish? You’re a woman? You’re next,” the California governor continued. 
On Tuesday, Target announced it was making “adjustments to our plans” to promote and sell Pride Month merchandise, which has been on sale since the beginning of May, ahead of Pride Month, which is June. Target attributed the decision to “volatile circumstances” that were impacting staff’s “sense of safety and well-being while at work.”
Target did not say which items would be removed from shelves but confirmed it moved its Pride merchandise to the back of some stores in the South.

“Since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and well-being while at work,” Target’s statement read. ”Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.”
According to the most recent FBI data, hate crimes reported against people targeted for their sexual orientation increased by 54 percent from 2020 to 2021. The same data show hate crimes against transgender and gender-nonconforming people increased by 29 percent in 2021.
Debate over the legality and morality of some gender-affirming health care has increased in recent years, with some states banning its administration to minors. Bud Light also recently received public backlash from some of its consumers after partnering with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney as part of a social media campaign.

A cluster of mpox cases in the Chicago area has spurred concerns of a resurgence this summer, mere months after the end of the public health emergency for the outbreak that began last year.
The U.S. response to the mpox outbreak in 2022 was heralded as a public health success despite some early stumbles. By the beginning of this year, enough progress had been made that the White House allowed the public health emergency to expire.


  

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week, however, there is a “substantial risk” of a resurgence this summer. This warning came days after the World Health Organization declared mpox to no longer be a global health emergency.
A worry is that investigators have found more than half of those infected in the Chicago cluster had received some degree of vaccination.
Nallely Mora, research assistant professor at Loyola University Chicago’s Parkinson School of Health Sciences and Public Health, believes the cluster may be the result of people being negligent of getting a full schedule of vaccines.
She noted that while rates of mpox cases became extremely low, ranging from one to three confirmed cases per day in recent months, the virus never went away entirely.
“We know the rates of people willing to get a complete vaccine schedule is not great,” Mora said. “Some of them, they may have their first dose and then maybe they forget to get to the point of the 28 days, when they need to get the second dose to acquire full immunity, and it’s just not happening.”
The discovery in Chicago has led experts to call for more inquiries into the efficacy and duration of the smallpox vaccines used during last year’s outbreak.


  

Because there is no immunization specifically geared toward mpox, the smallpox vaccines ACAM2000 and the newer Jynneos were deployed because the two viruses are closely related.
Jynneos, administered in two doses 28 days apart, became the most commonly administered shot because it is generally thought to have fewer side effects.
During the early parts of the mpox outbreak, many health departments’ supplies of Jynneos were stretched thin, with some resorting to administering all the doses they had on hand before knowing when they would have enough supplies to provide the second dose.


  

Due to these circumstances, many people fell through the cracks, not following up to get a second dose.
The difference between one dose and two doses of Jynneos is potentially vast. CDC officials noted during a press briefing that the estimated vaccine effectiveness from one dose of Jynneos ranged from 36 to 75 percent, while the effectiveness of two doses ranged from 66 to 86 percent. 
Martin Hirsch, professor of medicine at Harvard University, noted this difference is particularly more “dramatic” among immunocompromised individuals, who are less likely to develop as strong of an immune response as individuals with competent immune systems. This is especially troubling given what’s known about vaccination rates in the U.S.


  

“People who consider themselves at high risk and who are at high risk should get the primary vaccine dose,” Hirsch advised. “The data that I’ve seen in the United States is that only 23 percent of those considered at risk are now fully vaccinated.”
The CDC has so far not changed its recommendations on vaccine scheduling for mpox and has not specified whether previously immunized people should get a second course of shots ahead of this summer.
“CDC recommends that anyone at risk, anyone who has been infected, or anyone who has been exposed to mpox, get a total of two mpox vaccines,” the agency said when reached for comment.


  

Mora said individuals who have received an incomplete schedule of vaccines should see whether they can get a complete two-dose round. Those who got both doses, however, probably can wait before they inquire about further immunization.
“I don’t think there’s any indication that the vaccine efficacy wanes very quickly,” Hirsch said. “I don’t think people who have gotten their vaccines should be particularly concerned, unless they’re at particularly high risk.”

Groups that health authorities recommend get immunized include those who have been exposed to someone with mpox; men who have sex with men, transgender and gender-diverse people who have had more than one sex partner in the past six months; immunocompromised people; and those who work in high-risk settings, like clinics and hospitals.


  

In Hirsch’s opinion, the general population can hold off getting a shot for mpox because the risks could be greater than the benefit. He encouraged those with concerns to speak with their health care providers.
The mitigating strategies from last year still hold true, as well. Wash your hands; clean your clothes and linens if you’ve been infected; and avoid high-risk situations where skin-to-skin contact is more likely.

Every House Democrat has endorsed the discharge petition to force a vote on legislation to hike the debt ceiling and prevent a default, party leaders announced Wednesday.
The signatures of the two final holdouts — Reps. Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Ed Case (D-Hawaii) — puts the total number at 213, meaning Democratic leaders still need to find five Republicans for the petition to be successful.


  

“It takes a handful of members of the GOP to say, ‘Enough,’” Rep. Katherine Clark (Mass.), the Democratic whip, told reporters in the Capitol. 
That’s a heavy lift, since it would require GOP lawmakers to buck the wishes of Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who is in tense negotiations with the White House over a debt-ceiling package and is opposed to a vote on the “clean” debt-limit hike preferred by Democrats. 
The procedural gambit is a long shot: Only two discharge petitions have been successful in the last two decades. Still, Democratic leaders are hoping their party’s unanimity on the document will pressure moderate Republicans to sign on, particularly if talks between President Biden and McCarthy don’t yield fruit and the threat of default is imminent. 
“We’re five signatures away,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. “So for our Republican colleagues who give interviews and go back home and talk about how they want to work together, and talk about how they’re not extreme like Marjorie Taylor Greene, and how she doesn’t speak for them — this is their opportunity.” 
Some moderate Republicans have already hinted at a willingness to join Democrats on a discharge petition if Congress inches too close to a federal default with no resolution in sight. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a co-chairman of the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus, said earlier in the year that he might do so — “if that’s necessary.” 
Since then, however, House Republicans have passed a debt ceiling proposal of their own, which would extend the government’s borrowing authority by $1.5 trillion and reduce deficit spending by roughly $4.8 trillion over the next decade.

That’s the proposal McCarthy has taken into the negotiations as an opening bid, and Fitzpatrick more recently has thrown cold water on the idea of endorsing the Democrats’ discharge petition. 
“We’re not even close to anything like that,” Fitzpatrick said last week. “We already created a framework, and the Senate hasn’t acted. So the House can’t take Step 3 until at least Step 1 is passed. So the discharge petition is off the table.”

the signatures of the two final holdouts — reps jared golden dmaine and ed case dhawaii — puts the total number at 213 meaning democratic leaders still need to find five republicans for the petition to be successful


  

“it takes a handful of members of the gop to say ‘enough’” rep katherine clark mass the democratic whip told reporters in the capitol 
that’s a heavy lift since it would require gop lawmakers to buck the wishes of speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif who is in tense negotiations with the white house over a debtceiling package and is opposed to a vote on the “clean” debtlimit hike preferred by democrats 
the procedural gambit is a long shot only two discharge petitions have been successful in the last two decades still democratic leaders are hoping their party’s unanimity on the document will pressure moderate republicans to sign on particularly if talks between president biden and mccarthy don’t yield fruit and the threat of default is imminent 
“we’re five signatures away” said rep pete aguilar calif chairman of the house democratic caucus “so for our republican colleagues who give interviews and go back home and talk about how they want to work together and talk about how they’re not extreme like marjorie taylor greene and how she doesn’t speak for themthis is their opportunity” 
some moderate republicans have already hinted at a willingness to join democrats on a discharge petition if congress inches too close to a federal default with no resolution in sight rep brian fitzpatrick rpa a cochairman of the centrist problem solvers caucus said earlier in the year that he might do so“if that’s necessary” 
since then however house republicans have passed a debt ceiling proposal of their own which would extend the government’s borrowing authority by 15 trillion and reduce deficit spending by roughly 48 trillion over the next decade

that’s the proposal mccarthy has taken into the negotiations as an opening bid and fitzpatrick more recently has thrown cold water on the idea of endorsing the democrats’ discharge petition 
“we’re not even close to anything like that” fitzpatrick said last week “we already created a framework and the senate hasn’t acted so the house can’t take step 3 until at least step 1 is passed so the discharge petition is off the table”

Sixty percent of Americans say an increase in the debt ceiling should come with spending cuts, according to a poll conducted as Republicans in Congress and the White House negotiate how to prevent a default on the nation’s debt.
The CNN poll, released Tuesday, found six in 10 Americans say Congress should only lift the debt ceiling if it also cuts spending. 


  

Twenty-four percent said Congress should raise the debt ceiling “no matter what,” while 15 percent said Congress should not raise the debt ceiling “and allow the US to default on its debts.” 
The Treasury Department has warned that lawmakers have until June 1 before it runs out of ways to hold off default, which Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen and others have warned would mean economic catastrophe. 
The CNN poll’s results differ from a recent NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist national poll that found most respondents support lifting the debt ceiling and addressing spending cuts separately. 
Nearly three-quarters of Americans in Tuesday’s CNN poll said they think not raising the debt ceiling would cause either “major problems” (45 percent) or a “crisis” (26 percent).

Most Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents report concern that “Democrats will give up too much and important government programs will no longer be funded,” while most Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they’re worried that “Republicans will give up too much and government spending will continue at its current level.”
President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have been meeting for negotiations ahead of the looming deadline, as Republicans push for a borrowing limit increase tied to spending cuts and the White House urges a clean increase.


  

Conducted May 17-20, the CNN poll surveyed 1,227 U.S. adults and had a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points.

Chinese investors own about .03 percent of America’s farmland, according to federal data. But their land purchasing is becoming a major issue as politicians at the state and federal level ramp up their fight against perceived threats from China.
In the past couple of months, lawmakers in more than two dozen states have passed or considered legislation restricting Chinese purchases of U.S. farmland. 


  

And former President Trump has promised that if he retakes the White House, he will ban Chinese investors from buying U.S. farmland and other critical infrastructure, and force sales of their current holdings. 
“China has been spending trillions of dollars to take over the crown jewels of the United States’s economy,” Trump said in a campaign video in January. 
“To protect our country, we need to enact aggressive new restrictions on Chinese ownership of any vital infrastructure in the United States, including energy, technology, telecommunications, farmland, natural resources, medical supplies and other strategic national assets.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed multiple bills this month that prohibit Chinese citizens from purchasing land in the state. Last month, the North Carolina House passed a bill that would ban the governments of “foreign adversaries” from purchasing agricultural land as well as any land within 25 miles of a military installation. And the Texas Senate passed a bill last month that would ban citizens of China from buying property, with certain exceptions. 
Lawmakers on the federal level are also pushing legislation to block China from buying farmland. A bipartisan group of senators have introduced a bill, known as the PASS act, that would prohibit nationals of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from buying U.S. agricultural land or investing in American agricultural businesses. 
Other legislation focuses specifically on the Chinese government. The House easily passed an amendment to the Republican’s energy bill in late March prohibiting the Chinese Communist Party from purchasing U.S. farmland or land used for renewable energy. The broader bill was dead on arrival in the Democrat-controlled Senate. 


  

National security threat?
Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland has increased fivefold over the past decade, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, from 69,000 acres in 2011 to almost 384,000 acres in 2021. That amounts to about 1 percent of the 3 percent of all U.S. farmland owned by foreign nationals. 
The rate of this increase has not been even. A large portion of the increase came from a single purchase in 2013, when the Chinese company WH Group bought Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the U.S. 
After that, the amount of U.S. farmland owned by Chinese investors remained largely stagnant until 2019. Chinese-owned farmland increased by more than 136 thousand acres between 2019 and 2021, but this was almost entirely from acquisitions by U.S. companies with Chinese shareholders.


  

The new Republican majority in the House of Representatives has sought to make China a central focus, creating a select committee on “strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.”
One of the Republicans on the committee, Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), has repeatedly introduced legislation to prohibit the Chinese government from buying U.S. agricultural land. 
“I’ve always said that food security is literally national security,” Newhouse said at the committee’s first hearing in late February.


  

Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who testified at the hearing, agreed that this issue is cause for concern. He said the Chinese government is engaging in a concerted effort to make U.S. agriculture dependent on China.
“I describe in my written testimony the three Cs of co-option, coercion and concealment,” he said. “Co-opt by trying to build dependencies from U.S. agriculture on the Chinese market. And then, hey, once your in, then to use that for coercive purposes.”
However, a 2021 analysis by the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that foreign purchases of U.S. agricultural land are not a major threat to U.S. food security.


  

“The United States currently produces more than enough food per capita, even after adjusting for food waste,” CSIS analysts Jamie Lutz and Caitlin Welsh wrote. “Food insecurity among U.S. families is primarily driven by poverty, not a lack of food.”
Newhouse’s press secretary, Mike Marinella, said in an interview that even though Chinese investors currently own only a small portion of American farmland, the U.S. should be concerned about what could happen in the future.
“We don’t want to have to buy our food from China,” Marinella said.


  

Another area of concern is Chinese land purchases near military infrastructure. In 2021, Texas lawmakers passed legislation to prohibit a company owned by a Chinese billionaire from building a wind farm on 15,000 acres of ranchland near a U.S. Air Force base. 
That same year, Chinese food manufacturer Fufeng Group purchased 300 acres of farmland near Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota to build a corn mill, which the Pentagon deemed a threat to national security. 
Eric Chutorash, the chief operating officer of Fufeng Group’s U.S. subsidiary, repeatedly denied that the plans posed a security risk, as the company is publicly traded and not affiliated with the Chinese government. In February, however, the Grand Forks City Council voted unanimously to block the project.


  

Fueling anti-Asian sentiments
Some critics of efforts to limit Chinese purchases of U.S. farmland argue they could contribute to anti-Asian sentiments.
In a House Appropriations Committee hearing last year, Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) criticized an amendment from Newhouse to ban companies owned wholly or in part by the Chinese government from purchasing U.S. farmland. She said singling out China would “perpetuate already rising anti-Asian hate.”
“If the concern is about U.S. national security, other countries also should be included in this conversation,” Meng said.
Neysun Mahboubi, a research scholar at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for the Study of Contemporary China, said the hostile rhetoric toward China can be dangerous.
“[In] our American political culture, once we identify something as threatening, we’re not very good about talking about it in a nuanced and subtle way,” he said.

Mahboubi said it is important to discuss threats posed by China in a nuanced manner, especially given the high amount of trade the U.S. conducts with China. 
“We’re concerned about the implications for our food security of actions that China takes, [China could become] worried about what are the implications of their food security from actions that we take, until we’re locked in this sort of downward spiral,” Mahboubi said.
“I don’t think anyone can particularly anticipate how far it’s going to go or how damaging it could be.”

“i describe in my written testimony the three cs of cooption coercion and concealment” he said “coopt by trying to build dependencies from us agriculture on the chinese market and then hey once your in then to use that for coercive purposes”
however a 2021 analysis by the bipartisan center for strategic and international studies csis found that foreign purchases of us agricultural land are not a major threat to us food security


  

“the united states currently produces more than enough food per capita even after adjusting for food waste” csis analysts jamie lutz and caitlin welsh wrote “food insecurity among us families is primarily driven by poverty not a lack of food”
newhouse’s press secretary mike marinella said in an interview that even though chinese investors currently own only a small portion of american farmland the us should be concerned about what could happen in the future
“we don’t want to have to buy our food from china” marinella said


  

another area of concern is chinese land purchases near military infrastructure in 2021 texas lawmakers passed legislation to prohibit a company owned by a chinese billionaire from building a wind farm on 15000 acres of ranchland near a us air force base 
that same year chinese food manufacturer fufeng group purchased 300 acres of farmland near grand forks air force base in north dakota to build a corn mill which the pentagon deemed a threat to national security 
eric chutorash the chief operating officer of fufeng group’s us subsidiary repeatedly denied that the plans posed a security risk as the company is publicly traded and not affiliated with the chinese government in february however the grand forks city council voted unanimously to block the project


  

fueling antiasian sentiments
some critics of efforts to limit chinese purchases of us farmland argue they could contribute to antiasian sentiments
in a house appropriations committee hearing last year rep grace meng dny criticized an amendment from newhouse to ban companies owned wholly or in part by the chinese government from purchasing us farmland she said singling out china would “perpetuate already rising antiasian hate”
“if the concern is about us national security other countries also should be included in this conversation” meng said
neysun mahboubi a research scholar at the university of pennsylvania’s center for the study of contemporary china said the hostile rhetoric toward china can be dangerous
“in our american political culture once we identify something as threatening we’re not very good about talking about it in a nuanced and subtle way” he said

		despite widespread protest reddit ceo says company is ‘not negotiating’ on 3rdparty app charges	

mahboubi said it is important to discuss threats posed by china in a nuanced manner especially given the high amount of trade the us conducts with china 
“we’re concerned about the implications for our food security of actions that china takes china could become worried about what are the implications of their food security from actions that we take until we’re locked in this sort of downward spiral” mahboubi said
“i don’t think anyone can particularly anticipate how far it’s going to go or how damaging it could be”

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) dismissed the threat of the government defaulting on its debt saying “no one is freaking out” in the House Republican conference about the deadline.
Her remarks come even amid Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s repeated warnings of the severe economic consequences if Congress does not raise the debt ceiling by June 1.  


  

“Here’s what’s happening in our conference,” Greene told conservative podcast host Steve Bannon on Wednesday. “We’re not sweating this at all. No one is freaking out, no one is concerned about this mystery date that Janet Yellen has thrown out, like it’s going to actually crash America.”
“The only people worked up about the mystery date is probably the New York Stock Exchange,” she said. “I mean, let’s be real about exactly what it is. Regular Americans living their lives, day in and day out, don’t worry about the government shutting down.”
The comments come as House Republican negotiators head to the White House and Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has signaled optimism about the prospects of striking a deal. 
“I think we can make progress today,” he told reporters Wednesday.

But some Republicans in his conference still signal they won’t support a deal that has fewer spending cuts than the GOP-led bill that already passed the House. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said Tuesday that he and his conservative colleagues “don’t feel like we should negotiate with our hostage” on a debt-limit compromise.
McCarthy dismissed concerns when asked Wednesday to respond to those who question whether he can actually strike a deal, in light of positions held by Gaetz and others in his conference. 


  

“They’re wrong,” McCarthy said when asked about his skeptics. “You underestimated me the whole time.”

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the deadline to raise the debt ceiling is almost certainly in early June as lawmakers attempt to reach a deal to increase the limit before the country goes into default. 
Yellen said on Wednesday at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit that the country must not be allowed to default, and continuing to be able to pay U.S. debts is critical to continued U.S. leadership in the global economy and the role of the U.S. dollar in the world. 


  

“It seems almost certain that we will not be able to get past early June,” she said. 
Yellen has said the U.S. could default on its debts for the first time in its history as soon as June 1 if an agreement to raise the debt ceiling is not reached. She and other members of the Biden administration have warned that a default would likely cause the country to go into a recession and have wider impacts on the global economy. 
But some Republicans have recently shown doubt about June 1 being an exact deadline for a deal, calling on Yellen to demonstrate how she determined that date. 
Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and one of the main Republican negotiators, said he wants to “trust the Treasury’s math, but they’re going to have to show their work.” He said the White House does not seem to have urgency in reaching a deal, raising questions about the June 1 date. 
Other House Republicans like Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Ralph Norman (S.C.) have also questioned it.

		House GOP ponders action against DOJ in defense of Trump	

Republicans have demanded significant federal spending cuts in exchange for voting to raise the limit, while the Biden administration has sought to minimize the cuts made. 


  

Yellen noted that raising the debt ceiling does not allow the U.S. government to take on additional debts but pay off debts it has already incurred. 
“Essentially, we’ve bought things put on our credit card and then says we can’t pay the credit card bill. So, we simply must pay obligations that come due,” she said.

Democrats erupted in laughter on the House floor Wednesday when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — who was presiding over the chamber — called for decorum.
The heckling came as House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) was delivering floor remarks about the debt ceiling, which has been the subject of high-stakes negotiations between GOP lawmakers and the White House.


  

As Scalise was urging the Senate and White House to take action on raising the borrowing limit — referencing the bill House Republicans passed last month — Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) called him a liar.
“We are in fact the only body in this town who has actually taken steps to address the debt ceiling and the spending problem in Washington. I would encourage the Senate to take up the bill, I would encourage the president to get engaged and address this problem, but we already have, the votes are on the board —” Scalise said before pausing to react to Bowman.
Bowman’s office confirmed to The Hill that it was the congressman who yelled “liar” while Scalise was speaking.

“Order,” Greene said from the dais, pounding her gavel.
“I ask that the House be in order and there be some decorum on the other side,” Scalise said.
After a roughly 15-second pause, Greene called for decorum in the chamber.


  

“The members are reminded to abide by decorum of the House,” she said.
Democrats in the chamber then erupted in laughter. Some members — including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Cori Bush (D-Mo.) — stood from their seats and started shouting.
As the laughter continued, Greene slammed her gavel a number of times.


  

The Hill reached out to Greene for comment.
The Democrats’ reaction was a reflection of the controversy swirling around Greene’s own bombastic behavior since arriving on Capitol Hill, which at times has played out on the House floor. During President Biden’s State of the Union address in February, the Georgia Republican yelled “liar” as the president delivered remarks on Social Security and Medicare.
And last month, Greene was silenced during a Homeland Security Committee hearing after she accused Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of being a liar.


  

Following the laughter, Greene said “the House will be in order” and recognized Scalise to continue talking on the floor.
“While some in this town might be interested in theatrics, House Republicans took action,” Scalise said, prompting groans in the chamber. “We passed a bill to address the problem, it’s time for my friends on the other side to start doing their job, call the Senate back in to take up the bill.”

“If they don’t like it they can amend it, that is part of the legislative process. Let’s get our jobs done; we’ve done ours, they need to do theirs,” he added.


  

Scalise took to the House floor Wednesday to inform lawmakers that they can leave Washington for Memorial Day weekend but should be prepared to return to the Capitol with 24-hours notice to vote on a debt limit ceiling as negotiations over raising the borrowing limit drag on.
For more than a week, Republican lawmakers and White House negotiators have been engaging in talks to come to an agreement. Pressure, however, has mounted in recent days as the calendar inches closer to June 1 — the day that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned the U.S. could default by.
After announcing the scheduling plans, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) spoke on the House floor to criticize the GOP bill and celebrate that all members of the Democratic caucus signed on to a discharge petition, which liberal lawmakers are hoping can be used to force a vote on legislation to increase the borrowing limit.


  

Democrats erupted in applause.

        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by The Hill (@thehill)

While all 213 Democrats have signed onto the petition, the caucus needs five Republicans to join their effort to reach the threshold of a majority of the chamber, which is needed to force a vote through the discharge petition. That, however, is an unlikely scenario as Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has called on GOP lawmakers to stand behind him in negotiations.

Clark, however, called on Republicans to join the Democratic effort.


  

“It only takes five patriots to join us in the fight for the American people. Join us, sign the petition, stay here and fight for American families, fight for their American security,” she added.

GOP presidential candidate and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said Wednesday she would sign a federal abortion ban into law if she were president, but she dismissed the possibility of such a ban materializing, noting it was unlikely to get the necessary 60 votes to pass the Senate.
Haley’s comments are the clearest answer she has provided about her abortion position since she launched her campaign in February, becoming the only woman in the primary field so far.


  

“No one has been honest” about how difficult a ban would be to achieve, Haley said at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. 
“It would take a majority of the House, 60 senators and a president to sign it,” she said. “We haven’t had 60 Republican senators in 100 years.”
Haley also reiterated her support for the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had secured abortion rights on a federal level.
“Now it’s back in the states where it belongs,” she said Wednesday.

Last month, Haley attempted to outline her anti-abortion position in a speech at the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America headquarters. She stressed compassion and national consensus but provided few details about what she would support as president. 
Asked Wednesday how she would square her anti-abortion position in a state like New Hampshire, which is overwhelmingly pro-choice, she said, “I can’t suddenly change my pro-life position because I’m campaigning in New Hampshire,” noting, “It’s incredibly personal, and I’m going to treat it with the respect it deserves.”

The depth and breadth of the looming legal problems facing former President Trump are on full display this week after a rapid series of developments in various cases.
In the past few days alone, one of Trump’s top lawyers departed, citing internal friction, the special counsel has intensified his investigation into the former president’s conduct and writer E. Jean Carroll has filed for more damages after Trump mocked her sexual assault allegations at a CNN town hall.


  

Meanwhile, a New York judge called a hearing Tuesday to reiterate to Trump that rules surrounding his hush money prosecution bar him from using evidence in the case to attack any witnesses.
The specter of legal trouble is nothing new for Trump. Jack Smith, a Justice Department special counsel, is investigating his handling of classified information and his efforts to remain in power after the 2020 election. A Georgia prosecutor is probing attempts to overturn the state’s election results in 2020.

Trump was indicted earlier this year on charges related to an alleged hush money scheme to keep an affair quiet during the 2016 campaign, and he was recently found liable for defamation and sexual abuse of Carroll.
But the latest developments come as the 2024 GOP primary field takes shape, with Trump’s chief rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), set to enter the race this week, just days after Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) jumped in the contest Monday. 
The steady stream of news began in recent days when Timothy Parlatore, one of Trump’s attorneys handling the document case, resigned and went public with some of his concerns about the influence of some in the former president’s inner circle.


  

“It had nothing to do with the case itself or the client,” Parlatore told CNN’s Paula Reid.
“The real reason is because there are certain individuals that made defending the president much harder than it needed to be. In particular, there is one individual who works for him, Boris Epshteyn, who had really done everything he could to try to block us — to prevent us from doing what we could to defend the president.”

Parlatore said Epshteyn “served as kind of a filter to prevent us from getting information to the client. … In my opinion, he was not very honest with us or with the client on certain things.”


  

That includes major events in the case, including subsequent searches of Trump properties to assure there were no remaining classified records on the premises. 
“There were certain things, like the searches, that he attempted to interfere with,” Parlatore said.
Smith’s case against Trump, especially on the Mar-a-Lago front, appears to be accelerating. 


  

Parlatore told The Hill last week that Smith appeared to be wrapping up his presentation to the grand jury assembled in the case.
“I think that they’re just about done with all the grand jury witnesses at this point. And moving into the report writing phase,” he said. 
“I think that they’re going to spend the next month writing up a several-hundred-page report …and present it to [Attorney General Merrick Garland in the] beginning of June.”

The investigation has expanded to also include some of the Trump organization’s business dealings while the former president was still in office. 
Smith issued a subpoena for records of business deals that former President Trump’s company made with seven countries since he took office in 2017: China, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.


  

In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis signaled in recent days that charges in her investigation could come in early August. That case is focused on a “fake electors” scheme hatched by Trump allies after the 2020 election.
As those investigations play out, others are already expected to follow him into presidential primary season next spring. 
Attorneys for Carroll on Monday amended a complaint to seek additional damages from Trump after he called her a “whack job” and mocked her allegation that he raped her in an encounter in the 1990s. He made the comments during a CNN town hall earlier this month, the day after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The civil case will likely loom over the former president for months to come.


  




		Trump Justice Department kept Clinton Foundation case open until last days of presidency: report	


A Manhattan judge Tuesday tentatively set the trial date for Trump’s hush money case for March 2024, which would be right in the thick of primary voting. 
Also in that case, Justice Juan Merchan agreed to a request from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) to schedule a Tuesday hearing reviewing the limitations on how the former president may use the evidence he has access to during the trial.
Merchan has said Trump will remain free to speak about the “vast majority of the evidence” but that he may not directly post evidence to social media nor reveal information about witnesses involved in the case. He is also only allowed to review evidence in the presence of his attorneys.
Trump lashed out at the decision Tuesday.
“Just had New York County Supreme Court hearing where I believe my First Amendment Rights, “Freedom of Speech,” have been violated, and they forced upon us a trial date of March 25th, right in the middle of Primary season. Very unfair, but this is exactly what the Radical Left Democrats wanted. It’s called ELECTION INTERFERENCE, and nothing like this has ever happened in our Country before!!!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media site.
So far, the myriad controversies have yet to seriously harm Trump politically in the GOP race.
The former president’s polling lead has expanded since he was indicted last month in the hush money case, and his team of advisers believe he benefited from the CNN town hall, despite the potential legal implications of his comments about Carroll and classified documents he’d taken with him to his Mar-a-Lago estate.
A RealClearPolitics average of recent GOP primary polls shows Trump with a comfortable 37-percentage-point lead over DeSantis, who is polling in second place in most surveys.
“Great Poll Numbers, but the Communists are after me. Can’t let them succeed. MAGA!” Trump wrote on Truth Social this week.

Nearly seven in 10 registered independent respondents cited President Biden’s mental fitness as a major concern they have about his ability to be president as the 2024 election cycle inches near, a poll released Wednesday showed. 
The NPR/ PBS News Hour/Marist poll found that 69 percent of registered independent respondents said Biden’s mental fitness is a real concern about his ability to be president, and 27 percent of independent respondents believe Biden’s mental fitness is a campaign strategy used by his opponents. 


  

Along party lines, 84 percent of registered Republican respondents said that Biden’s mental fitness is a major concern about his ability to be president, and 36 percent of registered Democrat respondents shared the same sentiment.
Overall, 62 percent of respondents believe Biden’s mental fitness is a real concern about his ability to be president, and 36 percent of those surveyed said differently. 
Biden announced last month that he is running for reelection in 2024. As the country’s oldest president ever, he has faced questions about his age.

Biden and former President Trump could face off again for the White House in 2024, since Trump — who announced his third presidential campaign in November amid a slew of legal troubles — is the current favorite for the GOP nomination.

Democrats erupted in laughter on the House floor Wednesday when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) — who was presiding over the chamber — called for decorum.
The heckling came as House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) was delivering floor remarks about the debt ceiling, which has been the subject of high-stakes negotiations between GOP lawmakers and the White House.


  

As Scalise was urging the Senate and White House to take action on raising the borrowing limit — referencing the bill House Republicans passed last month — Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) called him a liar.
“We are in fact the only body in this town who has actually taken steps to address the debt ceiling and the spending problem in Washington. I would encourage the Senate to take up the bill, I would encourage the president to get engaged and address this problem, but we already have, the votes are on the board —” Scalise said before pausing to react to Bowman.
Bowman’s office confirmed to The Hill that it was the congressman who yelled “liar” while Scalise was speaking.

“Order,” Greene said from the dais, pounding her gavel.
“I ask that the House be in order and there be some decorum on the other side,” Scalise said.
After a roughly 15-second pause, Greene called for decorum in the chamber.


  

“The members are reminded to abide by decorum of the House,” she said.
Democrats in the chamber then erupted in laughter. Some members — including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Cori Bush (D-Mo.) — stood from their seats and started shouting.
As the laughter continued, Greene slammed her gavel a number of times.


  

The Hill reached out to Greene for comment.
The Democrats’ reaction was a reflection of the controversy swirling around Greene’s own bombastic behavior since arriving on Capitol Hill, which at times has played out on the House floor. During President Biden’s State of the Union address in February, the Georgia Republican yelled “liar” as the president delivered remarks on Social Security and Medicare.
And last month, Greene was silenced during a Homeland Security Committee hearing after she accused Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of being a liar.


  

Following the laughter, Greene said “the House will be in order” and recognized Scalise to continue talking on the floor.
“While some in this town might be interested in theatrics, House Republicans took action,” Scalise said, prompting groans in the chamber. “We passed a bill to address the problem, it’s time for my friends on the other side to start doing their job, call the Senate back in to take up the bill.”

“If they don’t like it they can amend it, that is part of the legislative process. Let’s get our jobs done; we’ve done ours, they need to do theirs,” he added.


  

Scalise took to the House floor Wednesday to inform lawmakers that they can leave Washington for Memorial Day weekend but should be prepared to return to the Capitol with 24-hours notice to vote on a debt limit ceiling as negotiations over raising the borrowing limit drag on.
For more than a week, Republican lawmakers and White House negotiators have been engaging in talks to come to an agreement. Pressure, however, has mounted in recent days as the calendar inches closer to June 1 — the day that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned the U.S. could default by.
After announcing the scheduling plans, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) spoke on the House floor to criticize the GOP bill and celebrate that all members of the Democratic caucus signed on to a discharge petition, which liberal lawmakers are hoping can be used to force a vote on legislation to increase the borrowing limit.


  

Democrats erupted in applause.

        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by The Hill (@thehill)

While all 213 Democrats have signed onto the petition, the caucus needs five Republicans to join their effort to reach the threshold of a majority of the chamber, which is needed to force a vote through the discharge petition. That, however, is an unlikely scenario as Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has called on GOP lawmakers to stand behind him in negotiations.

Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN on Wednesday “everyone is going to get hurt” if the nation defaults, adding it’s “just a matter of degree.”
Zandi said 401(k) plans and other pension assets will decline in value, and borrowing money for mortgages or purchasing a car will be more difficult, especially as interest rates will rise. And people who rely on government checks, from Social Security support to military salaries, could receive money later than usual.


  

Zandi said the earliest the nation might run out of funds is June 1, but the most likely deadline is June 8, based on his calculations. Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated Wednesday that the U.S. government is “almost certain” to miss payments in early June, without a deal to raise the debt ceiling. 
Zandi said that would sink the country into a recession, spurring unemployment and stifling raises. 
He added that the debt ceiling is “counterproductive” to solving the country’s economic problems, saying instead that Congress needs to restrain government spending and increase tax revenue.
As Republicans have expressed skepticism about the June 1 deadline and insisted on spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, some Democrats have urged Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment to act unilaterally. The constitutional amendment says U.S. debts “shall not be questioned,” though its applicability to the debt ceiling is untested.
Zandi said invoking the 14th Amendment to address the debt ceiling would “create a lot of chaos” because such a decision could face legal challenges and potentially be overturned by a Supreme Court controlled by conservatives.

However, Zandi said if the nation runs out of funds, it still might be the most desirable option to choose.


  

“Then it’s a Hobson’s choice. Which is the worst bad choice? And the 14th Amendment may be the best bad choice to take,” Zandi said.
Yellen has warned invoking the 14th Amendment could raise a “constitutional crisis.”

Chinese investors own about .03 percent of America’s farmland, according to federal data. But their land purchasing is becoming a major issue as politicians at the state and federal level ramp up their fight against perceived threats from China.
In the past couple of months, lawmakers in more than two dozen states have passed or considered legislation restricting Chinese purchases of U.S. farmland. 


  

And former President Trump has promised that if he retakes the White House, he will ban Chinese investors from buying U.S. farmland and other critical infrastructure, and force sales of their current holdings. 
“China has been spending trillions of dollars to take over the crown jewels of the United States’s economy,” Trump said in a campaign video in January. 
“To protect our country, we need to enact aggressive new restrictions on Chinese ownership of any vital infrastructure in the United States, including energy, technology, telecommunications, farmland, natural resources, medical supplies and other strategic national assets.”
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed multiple bills this month that prohibit Chinese citizens from purchasing land in the state. Last month, the North Carolina House passed a bill that would ban the governments of “foreign adversaries” from purchasing agricultural land as well as any land within 25 miles of a military installation. And the Texas Senate passed a bill last month that would ban citizens of China from buying property, with certain exceptions. 
Lawmakers on the federal level are also pushing legislation to block China from buying farmland. A bipartisan group of senators have introduced a bill, known as the PASS act, that would prohibit nationals of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from buying U.S. agricultural land or investing in American agricultural businesses. 
Other legislation focuses specifically on the Chinese government. The House easily passed an amendment to the Republican’s energy bill in late March prohibiting the Chinese Communist Party from purchasing U.S. farmland or land used for renewable energy. The broader bill was dead on arrival in the Democrat-controlled Senate. 


  

National security threat?
Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland has increased fivefold over the past decade, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data, from 69,000 acres in 2011 to almost 384,000 acres in 2021. That amounts to about 1 percent of the 3 percent of all U.S. farmland owned by foreign nationals. 
The rate of this increase has not been even. A large portion of the increase came from a single purchase in 2013, when the Chinese company WH Group bought Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the U.S. 
After that, the amount of U.S. farmland owned by Chinese investors remained largely stagnant until 2019. Chinese-owned farmland increased by more than 136 thousand acres between 2019 and 2021, but this was almost entirely from acquisitions by U.S. companies with Chinese shareholders.


  

The new Republican majority in the House of Representatives has sought to make China a central focus, creating a select committee on “strategic competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.”
One of the Republicans on the committee, Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), has repeatedly introduced legislation to prohibit the Chinese government from buying U.S. agricultural land. 
“I’ve always said that food security is literally national security,” Newhouse said at the committee’s first hearing in late February.


  

Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who testified at the hearing, agreed that this issue is cause for concern. He said the Chinese government is engaging in a concerted effort to make U.S. agriculture dependent on China.
“I describe in my written testimony the three Cs of co-option, coercion and concealment,” he said. “Co-opt by trying to build dependencies from U.S. agriculture on the Chinese market. And then, hey, once your in, then to use that for coercive purposes.”
However, a 2021 analysis by the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) found that foreign purchases of U.S. agricultural land are not a major threat to U.S. food security.


  

“The United States currently produces more than enough food per capita, even after adjusting for food waste,” CSIS analysts Jamie Lutz and Caitlin Welsh wrote. “Food insecurity among U.S. families is primarily driven by poverty, not a lack of food.”
Newhouse’s press secretary, Mike Marinella, said in an interview that even though Chinese investors currently own only a small portion of American farmland, the U.S. should be concerned about what could happen in the future.
“We don’t want to have to buy our food from China,” Marinella said.


  

Another area of concern is Chinese land purchases near military infrastructure. In 2021, Texas lawmakers passed legislation to prohibit a company owned by a Chinese billionaire from building a wind farm on 15,000 acres of ranchland near a U.S. Air Force base. 
That same year, Chinese food manufacturer Fufeng Group purchased 300 acres of farmland near Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota to build a corn mill, which the Pentagon deemed a threat to national security. 
Eric Chutorash, the chief operating officer of Fufeng Group’s U.S. subsidiary, repeatedly denied that the plans posed a security risk, as the company is publicly traded and not affiliated with the Chinese government. In February, however, the Grand Forks City Council voted unanimously to block the project.


  

Fueling anti-Asian sentiments
Some critics of efforts to limit Chinese purchases of U.S. farmland argue they could contribute to anti-Asian sentiments.
In a House Appropriations Committee hearing last year, Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) criticized an amendment from Newhouse to ban companies owned wholly or in part by the Chinese government from purchasing U.S. farmland. She said singling out China would “perpetuate already rising anti-Asian hate.”
“If the concern is about U.S. national security, other countries also should be included in this conversation,” Meng said.
Neysun Mahboubi, a research scholar at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for the Study of Contemporary China, said the hostile rhetoric toward China can be dangerous.
“[In] our American political culture, once we identify something as threatening, we’re not very good about talking about it in a nuanced and subtle way,” he said.

Mahboubi said it is important to discuss threats posed by China in a nuanced manner, especially given the high amount of trade the U.S. conducts with China. 
“We’re concerned about the implications for our food security of actions that China takes, [China could become] worried about what are the implications of their food security from actions that we take, until we’re locked in this sort of downward spiral,” Mahboubi said.
“I don’t think anyone can particularly anticipate how far it’s going to go or how damaging it could be.”

chinese investors own about 03 percent of america’s farmland according to federal data but their land purchasing is becoming a major issue as politicians at the state and federal level ramp up their fight against perceived threats from china
in the past couple of months lawmakers in more than two dozen states have passed or considered legislation restricting chinese purchases of us farmland 


  

and former president trump has promised that if he retakes the white house he will ban chinese investors from buying us farmland and other critical infrastructure and force sales of their current holdings 
“china has been spending trillions of dollars to take over the crown jewels of the united states’s economy” trump said in a campaign video in january 
“to protect our country we need to enact aggressive new restrictions on chinese ownership of any vital infrastructure in the united states including energy technology telecommunications farmland natural resources medical supplies and other strategic national assets”
florida gov ron desantis r signed multiple bills this month that prohibit chinese citizens from purchasing land in the state last month the north carolina house passed a bill that would ban the governments of “foreign adversaries” from purchasing agricultural land as well as any land within 25 miles of a military installation and the texas senate passed a bill last month that would ban citizens of china from buying property with certain exceptions 
lawmakers on the federal level are also pushing legislation to block china from buying farmland a bipartisan group of senators have introduced a bill known as the pass act that would prohibit nationals of china russia iran and north korea from buying us agricultural land or investing in american agricultural businesses 
other legislation focuses specifically on the chinese government the house easily passed an amendment to the republican’s energy bill in late march prohibiting the chinese communist party from purchasing us farmland or land used for renewable energy the broader bill was dead on arrival in the democratcontrolled senate 


  

national security threat
chinese ownership of us farmland has increased fivefold over the past decade according to us department of agriculture usda data from 69000 acres in 2011 to almost 384000 acres in 2021 that amounts to about 1 percent of the 3 percent of all us farmland owned by foreign nationals 
the rate of this increase has not been even a large portion of the increase came from a single purchase in 2013 when the chinese company wh group bought smithfield foods the largest pork producer in the us 
after that the amount of us farmland owned by chinese investors remained largely stagnant until 2019 chineseowned farmland increased by more than 136 thousand acres between 2019 and 2021 but this was almost entirely from acquisitions by us companies with chinese shareholders


  

the new republican majority in the house of representatives has sought to make china a central focus creating a select committee on “strategic competition between the united states and the chinese communist party”
one of the republicans on the committee rep dan newhouse rwash has repeatedly introduced legislation to prohibit the chinese government from buying us agricultural land 
“i’ve always said that food security is literally national security” newhouse said at the committee’s first hearing in late february


  

former trump national security adviser hr mcmaster who testified at the hearing agreed that this issue is cause for concern he said the chinese government is engaging in a concerted effort to make us agriculture dependent on china
“i describe in my written testimony the three cs of cooption coercion and concealment” he said “coopt by trying to build dependencies from us agriculture on the chinese market and then hey once your in then to use that for coercive purposes”
however a 2021 analysis by the bipartisan center for strategic and international studies csis found that foreign purchases of us agricultural land are not a major threat to us food security


  

“the united states currently produces more than enough food per capita even after adjusting for food waste” csis analysts jamie lutz and caitlin welsh wrote “food insecurity among us families is primarily driven by poverty not a lack of food”
newhouse’s press secretary mike marinella said in an interview that even though chinese investors currently own only a small portion of american farmland the us should be concerned about what could happen in the future
“we don’t want to have to buy our food from china” marinella said

eric chutorash the chief operating officer of fufeng group’s us subsidiary repeatedly denied that the plans posed a security risk as the company is publicly traded and not affiliated with the chinese government in february however the grand forks city council voted unanimously to block the project

The depth and breadth of the looming legal problems facing former President Trump are on full display this week after a rapid series of developments in various cases.
In the past few days alone, one of Trump’s top lawyers departed, citing internal friction, the special counsel has intensified his investigation into the former president’s conduct and writer E. Jean Carroll has filed for more damages after Trump mocked her sexual assault allegations at a CNN town hall.


  

Meanwhile, a New York judge called a hearing Tuesday to reiterate to Trump that rules surrounding his hush money prosecution bar him from using evidence in the case to attack any witnesses.
The specter of legal trouble is nothing new for Trump. Jack Smith, a Justice Department special counsel, is investigating his handling of classified information and his efforts to remain in power after the 2020 election. A Georgia prosecutor is probing attempts to overturn the state’s election results in 2020.

Trump was indicted earlier this year on charges related to an alleged hush money scheme to keep an affair quiet during the 2016 campaign, and he was recently found liable for defamation and sexual abuse of Carroll.
But the latest developments come as the 2024 GOP primary field takes shape, with Trump’s chief rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), set to enter the race this week, just days after Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) jumped in the contest Monday. 
The steady stream of news began in recent days when Timothy Parlatore, one of Trump’s attorneys handling the document case, resigned and went public with some of his concerns about the influence of some in the former president’s inner circle.


  

“It had nothing to do with the case itself or the client,” Parlatore told CNN’s Paula Reid.
“The real reason is because there are certain individuals that made defending the president much harder than it needed to be. In particular, there is one individual who works for him, Boris Epshteyn, who had really done everything he could to try to block us — to prevent us from doing what we could to defend the president.”

More coverage of Donald Trump from The Hill:

Trump defends refusal to back abortion ban: ‘Exceptions are very important’


Parlatore said Epshteyn “served as kind of a filter to prevent us from getting information to the client. … In my opinion, he was not very honest with us or with the client on certain things.”


  

That includes major events in the case, including subsequent searches of Trump properties to assure there were no remaining classified records on the premises. 
“There were certain things, like the searches, that he attempted to interfere with,” Parlatore said.
Smith’s case against Trump, especially on the Mar-a-Lago front, appears to be accelerating. 


  

Parlatore told The Hill last week that Smith appeared to be wrapping up his presentation to the grand jury assembled in the case.
“I think that they’re just about done with all the grand jury witnesses at this point. And moving into the report writing phase,” he said. 
“I think that they’re going to spend the next month writing up a several-hundred-page report …and present it to [Attorney General Merrick Garland in the] beginning of June.”

The investigation has expanded to also include some of the Trump organization’s business dealings while the former president was still in office. 
Smith issued a subpoena for records of business deals that former President Trump’s company made with seven countries since he took office in 2017: China, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.


  

In Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis signaled in recent days that charges in her investigation could come in early August. That case is focused on a “fake electors” scheme hatched by Trump allies after the 2020 election.
As those investigations play out, others are already expected to follow him into presidential primary season next spring. 
Attorneys for Carroll on Monday amended a complaint to seek additional damages from Trump after he called her a “whack job” and mocked her allegation that he raped her in an encounter in the 1990s. He made the comments during a CNN town hall earlier this month, the day after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The civil case will likely loom over the former president for months to come.


  




		Trump Justice Department kept Clinton Foundation case open until last days of presidency: report	


A Manhattan judge Tuesday tentatively set the trial date for Trump’s hush money case for March 2024, which would be right in the thick of primary voting. 
Also in that case, Justice Juan Merchan agreed to a request from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) to schedule a Tuesday hearing reviewing the limitations on how the former president may use the evidence he has access to during the trial.
Merchan has said Trump will remain free to speak about the “vast majority of the evidence” but that he may not directly post evidence to social media nor reveal information about witnesses involved in the case. He is also only allowed to review evidence in the presence of his attorneys.
Trump lashed out at the decision Tuesday.
“Just had New York County Supreme Court hearing where I believe my First Amendment Rights, “Freedom of Speech,” have been violated, and they forced upon us a trial date of March 25th, right in the middle of Primary season. Very unfair, but this is exactly what the Radical Left Democrats wanted. It’s called ELECTION INTERFERENCE, and nothing like this has ever happened in our Country before!!!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media site.
So far, the myriad controversies have yet to seriously harm Trump politically in the GOP race.
The former president’s polling lead has expanded since he was indicted last month in the hush money case, and his team of advisers believe he benefited from the CNN town hall, despite the potential legal implications of his comments about Carroll and classified documents he’d taken with him to his Mar-a-Lago estate.
A RealClearPolitics average of recent GOP primary polls shows Trump with a comfortable 37-percentage-point lead over DeSantis, who is polling in second place in most surveys.
“Great Poll Numbers, but the Communists are after me. Can’t let them succeed. MAGA!” Trump wrote on Truth Social this week.

the depth and breadth of the looming legal problems facing former president trump are on full display this week after a rapid series of developments in various cases
in the past few days alone one of trump’s top lawyers departed citing internal friction the special counsel has intensified his investigation into the former president’s conduct and writer e jean carroll has filed for more damages after trump mocked her sexual assault allegations at a  town hall


  

meanwhile a new york judge called a hearing tuesday to reiterate to trump that rules surrounding his hush money prosecution bar him from using evidence in the case to attack any witnesses

trump was indicted earlier this year on charges related to an alleged hush money scheme to keep an affair quiet during the 2016 campaign and he was recently found liable for defamation and sexual abuse of carroll
but the latest developments come as the 2024 gop primary field takes shape with trump’s chief rival florida gov ron desantis r set to enter the race this week just days after sen tim scott rsc jumped in the contest monday 
the steady stream of news began in recent days when timothy parlatore one of trump’s attorneys handling the document case resigned and went public with some of his concerns about the influence of some in the former president’s inner circle


  

“it had nothing to do with the case itself or the client” parlatore told ’s paula reid
“the real reason is because there are certain individuals that made defending the president much harder than it needed to be in particular there is one individual who works for him boris epshteyn who had really done everything he could to try to block usto prevent us from doing what we could to defend the president”

that includes major events in the case including subsequent searches of trump properties to assure there were no remaining classified records on the premises 
“there were certain things like the searches that he attempted to interfere with” parlatore said
smith’s case against trump especially on the maralago front appears to be accelerating 


  

parlatore told the hill last week that smith appeared to be wrapping up his presentation to the grand jury assembled in the case
“i think that they’re just about done with all the grand jury witnesses at this point and moving into the report writing phase” he said 
“i think that they’re going to spend the next month writing up a severalhundredpage report …and present it to attorney general merrick garland in the beginning of june”

attorneys for carroll on monday amended a complaint to seek additional damages from trump after he called her a “whack job” and mocked her allegation that he raped her in an encounter in the 1990s he made the comments during a  town hall earlier this month the day after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation the civil case will likely loom over the former president for months to come

also in that case justice juan merchan agreed to a request from manhattan district attorney alvin bragg d to schedule a tuesday hearing reviewing the limitations on how the former president may use the evidence he has access to during the trial
merchan has said trump will remain free to speak about the “vast majority of the evidence” but that he may not directly post evidence to social media nor reveal information about witnesses involved in the case he is also only allowed to review evidence in the presence of his attorneys
trump lashed out at the decision tuesday
“just had new york county supreme court hearing where i believe my first amendment rights “freedom of speech” have been violated and they forced upon us a trial date of march 25th right in the middle of primary season very unfair but this is exactly what the radical left democrats wanted it’s called election interference and nothing like this has ever happened in our country before” trump wrote in a post on his social media site
so far the myriad controversies have yet to seriously harm trump politically in the gop race
the former president’s polling lead has expanded since he was indicted last month in the hush money case and his team of advisers believe he benefited from the  town hall despite the potential legal implications of his comments about carroll and classified documents he’d taken with him to his maralago estate

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said Thursday that if elected president, he will consider pardoning all the Jan. 6 defendants — including former President Trump — on his first day in office.
“On day one, I will have folks that will get together and look at all these cases, who people are victims of weaponization or political targeting, and we will be aggressive in issuing pardons,” DeSantis said on “The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show” podcast when asked about whether he will consider pardoning Jan. 6 defendants, including Trump, who is currently facing a federal investigation over his role on Jan. 6.


  

“I would say any example of disfavored treatment based on politics, or weaponization would be included in that review, no matter how small or how big,” he added.

DeSantis also accused the Justice Department and the FBI of weaponizing its authority by pursuing ongoing investigations into the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. The Justice Department said earlier this month that 1,033 arrests have been made in connection to the Capitol attacks and about 485 people have been sentenced due to criminal activity conducted that day.  
DeSantis also claimed that the FBI is targeting anti-abortion groups, as well as parents who want to attend school board meetings. He said that if elected, his administration would determine on a “case-by-case” basis if the government was weaponized against certain groups.  
“We’re going to find examples where the government’s been weaponized against disfavored groups, and we will apply relief as appropriate, but it will be done on a case-by-case basis,” he said.

The Supreme Court’s major wetlands case on Thursday was technically unanimous as all nine justices ruled against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
But beneath the surface of the Idaho landowners’ win, the court’s three liberals and conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined to push back on how far the majority narrowed which wetlands are protected. 


  

Writing for the 5-4 majority, conservative Justice Samuel Alito ruled that eligible wetlands must have a “continuous surface connection” with a protected body of water, making the two areas “indistinguishable” from one another.
That narrow definition handed a win to Michael and Chantell Sackett, whom the EPA had previously prevented from building a home on land they owned, and it more broadly limited the EPA’s authority in terms of where it can implement safeguards.
“By narrowing the Act’s coverage of wetlands to only adjoining wetlands, the Court’s new test will leave some long-regulated adjacent wetlands no longer covered by the Clean Water Act, with significant repercussions for water quality and flood control throughout the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote in a separate opinion.
Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court’s three liberals, joined Kavanaugh’s opinion, which criticized the majority’s test as “atextual.”
The daylight between the two sides concerned wetlands that are separated from a covered water only by a manmade dike or barrier, natural river berm or a beach dune. Kavanaugh contended that Congress wrote the Clean Water Act to protect those, as well.

“I would stick to the text,” Kavanaugh wrote. “There can be no debate, in my respectful view, that the key statutory term is ‘adjacent’ and that adjacent wetlands is a broader category than adjoining wetlands. To be faithful to the statutory text, we cannot interpret ‘adjacent’ wetlands to be the same thing as ‘adjoining’ wetlands.”


  

Kagan also authored a separate opinion, joined only by the court’s other two liberals, forcefully pushing back on the majority’s test. Alito, meanwhile, said the increased protections read the statute too broadly and the separate opinions “cannot be taken seriously.”
“The EPA argues that ‘waters’ is ‘naturally read to encompass wetlands’ because the presence of water is ‘universally regarded as the most basic feature of wetlands’ … but that reading proves too much. Consider puddles, which are also defined by the ordinary presence of water even though few would describe them as ‘waters,'” Alito wrote.

With time running short and the danger of a national default growing, Democrats are hoping an unlikely savior will come to the rescue: Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.). 
Democratic lawmakers say McConnell and other Senate Republicans are fooling themselves if they think Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is in a position to reach a debt ceiling deal with President Biden. 


  

They believe McCarthy is under tremendous pressure not to agree to any deal Democrats would accept because the House rules allow for one disappointed conservative to offer a motion to vacate the Speaker’s chair. 
“Senate Republicans are putting their heads in the sand if they think that the extremists in their party will have a change of heart,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, to reporters earlier this month.  
“If Kevin McCarthy is forced to choose between holding power in his Speakership or taking us closer to default, we know he’s going to choose default. The American people know that as well. House Republicans are on a path toward default. The question before us is will Senate Republicans take the wheel?” he said.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a leader of House progressives, has joined the growing chorus of Democrats pleading for McConnell to get involved.  
“I think time is starting to run out,” Jayapal warned. “I think Wall Street should be weighing in.” 
She told reporters that “reasonable Republicans” and McConnell need “to get involved and get people to understand that default on America would be terrible,” according to Punchbowl News. 


  


House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., talk to reporters after meeting with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of N.Y., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., in the Oval Office of the White House, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, in Washington, about the debt ceiling. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)
Philip Wallach, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said McConnell has remained in the background in deference to the new GOP Speaker. But that could change, he added, if an agreement remains elusive and the threat of default creeps closer.   
“I think he’s trying to give McCarthy room to operate. And that’s professional courtesy and good partisan strategy,” Wallach said. “I don’t think that it necessarily means that he won’t be a big part of the final solution.” 


  

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) this week demonstrated why Democrats are nervous, saying his conservative colleagues “don’t feel like we should negotiate with our hostage,” and that “the one-person motion to vacate has given us the best version of Speaker McCarthy.”
But McConnell’s allies say Aguilar and Jayapal are misguided if they think the Senate GOP leader will override McCarthy.  
“I don’t think Mitch is going to get in the way of the Speaker because he knows if he does, that will undermine the Speaker’s ability to retain the Speakership. So until the president and the Speaker reach an agreement, I don’t see McConnell getting into the room,” said former Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), who once served on McConnell’s Senate leadership team.

Gregg argued that if McConnell cuts a deal with Biden instead of McCarthy, the deal would have a harder time passing the GOP-controlled House. 
“It would mean that the Speaker would have an even harder time selling whatever was agreed to to his caucus,” he said.  
Gregg said Democrats are calling for McConnell’s help in an effort to portray McCarthy as an unreasonable negotiator. 


  

“It’s politics,” he said. “They want to blame this on the Speaker.” 

Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) speaks to reporters concerning the debt ceiling negotiations on the steps of the Capitol, Thursday, May 25, 2023.
Jayapal’s comments caught the attention of some Senate Republican aides because the outspoken liberal leader is more likely to be quoted criticizing McConnell than beseeching his help.


  

But McConnell has his own right flank to worry about after Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) challenged his leadership position in November. McConnell won the race 36-10, but Senate conservatives sent a message that they weren’t happy with the direction of the GOP conference. 
Conservative senators were caught off guard when McConnell proposed in fall 2021 that Democrats could move legislation to raise the debt limit without having to face a GOP filibuster.
McConnell said at the time he made the offer so Democrats would fully own the decision to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the debt.  


  

“Democrats are simply voicing their expectations for something that already happened in the past to happen again,” one Senate Republican aide said of the calls by Aguilar and Jayapal to get involved in the debt limit talks.

The GOP aide noted McConnell initially took a hard line against raising the debt limit while Biden was in office, sending a letter to the president warning, “I will not be a party to any future effort to mitigate the consequences of Democratic mismanagement,” and that Democratic leaders “cannot invent another crisis and ask for my help.” 
“I get that McConnell doesn’t want to be the main guy in this fight,” the aide said. “But Jayapal wouldn’t be calling on somebody to get involved unless she thought that person would push for a clean debt ceiling hike, because that’s her position.” 
McConnell has warned repeatedly this year that he will stay out of the debt limit negotiations entirely. 
He told The Wall Street Journal in an interview last week he agreed in January that McCarthy would be the Republican point person in the negotiations.  
“The two of us agreed from the beginning that it was important for him to take the lead,” he said.  
Yet, Senate Democrats are also rooting for McConnell to step in to prevent a default, which appears more possible with each passing day as Biden and McCarthy remain far apart on a potential deal. 
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) told reporters earlier this month he felt “slightly better” about avoiding a fiscal catastrophe after McConnell declared “the United States is not going to default, it never has and it never will.”  

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) speaks to a reporter near the Senate Chamber during a series of votes regarding nominations on Tuesday, May 2, 2023.
McConnell made those comments outside the White House after a meeting with Biden and McCarthy.  
The Senate GOP leader tried to reassure the media and the financial markets again Tuesday and emphasized it would be up to the president and Speaker, not himself, to work out a deal.   
“I think everybody needs to relax,” McConnell told reporters in Kentucky.   
“Regardless of what may be said about the talks … the president and the Speaker will reach an agreement. It will ultimately pass on a bipartisan vote in both the House and the Senate,” he said. “The country will not default.” 
McConnell himself has argued any debt limit deal reached in the Senate wouldn’t have a chance of passing the GOP-controlled House. 
Yet, Democrats are betting that McConnell will be forced to intervene at the last moment once the nation is on the brink of default, threatening chaos in the financial markets and a recession — just as he did most famously in summer 2011 when then-President Obama and then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) were at loggerheads over raising the debt limit.  
“I understand the convenience of passing the buck in this building, but in the end, Sen. McConnell always has his own opinion,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told The Hill earlier this month. “He doesn’t outsource his opinions and votes to Speaker McCarthy.”

with time running short and the danger of a national default growing democrats are hoping an unlikely savior will come to the rescue senate republican leader mitch mcconnell ky 
democratic lawmakers say mcconnell and other senate republicans are fooling themselves if they think speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif is in a position to reach a debt ceiling deal with president biden 


  

they believe mccarthy is under tremendous pressure not to agree to any deal democrats would accept because the house rules allow for one disappointed conservative to offer a motion to vacate the speaker’s chair 
“senate republicans are putting their heads in the sand if they think that the extremists in their party will have a change of heart” said rep pete aguilar calif chairman of the house democratic caucus to reporters earlier this month  
“if kevin mccarthy is forced to choose between holding power in his speakership or taking us closer to default we know he’s going to choose default the american people know that as well house republicans are on a path toward default the question before us is will senate republicans take the wheel” he said

rep pramila jayapal dwash a leader of house progressives has joined the growing chorus of democrats pleading for mcconnell to get involved  
“i think time is starting to run out” jayapal warned “i think wall street should be weighing in” 
she told reporters that “reasonable republicans” and mcconnell need “to get involved and get people to understand that default on america would be terrible” according to punchbowl news 


  


house speaker kevin mccarthy of calif and senate minority leader mitch mcconnell of ky talk to reporters after meeting with president joe biden vice president kamala harris house minority leader hakeem jeffries of ny and senate majority leader chuck schumer of ny in the oval office of the white house tuesday may 16 2023 in washington about the debt ceiling ap photoevan vucci
philip wallach senior fellow at the american enterprise institute said mcconnell has remained in the background in deference to the new gop speaker but that could change he added if an agreement remains elusive and the threat of default creeps closer   
“i think he’s trying to give mccarthy room to operate and that’s professional courtesy and good partisan strategy” wallach said “i don’t think that it necessarily means that he won’t be a big part of the final solution” 


  

rep matt gaetz rfla this week demonstrated why democrats are nervous saying his conservative colleagues “don’t feel like we should negotiate with our hostage” and that “the oneperson motion to vacate has given us the best version of speaker mccarthy”
but mcconnell’s allies say aguilar and jayapal are misguided if they think the senate gop leader will override mccarthy  
“i don’t think mitch is going to get in the way of the speaker because he knows if he does that will undermine the speaker’s ability to retain the speakership so until the president and the speaker reach an agreement i don’t see mcconnell getting into the room” said former sen judd gregg rnh who once served on mcconnell’s senate leadership team

gregg argued that if mcconnell cuts a deal with biden instead of mccarthy the deal would have a harder time passing the gopcontrolled house 
“it would mean that the speaker would have an even harder time selling whatever was agreed to to his caucus” he said  
gregg said democrats are calling for mcconnell’s help in an effort to portray mccarthy as an unreasonable negotiator 


  

“it’s politics” he said “they want to blame this on the speaker” 

speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif speaks to reporters concerning the debt ceiling negotiations on the steps of the capitol thursday may 25 2023
jayapal’s comments caught the attention of some senate republican aides because the outspoken liberal leader is more likely to be quoted criticizing mcconnell than beseeching his help


  

but mcconnell has his own right flank to worry about after sen rick scott rfla challenged his leadership position in november mcconnell won the race 3610 but senate conservatives sent a message that they weren’t happy with the direction of the gop conference 
conservative senators were caught off guard when mcconnell proposed in fall 2021 that democrats could move legislation to raise the debt limit without having to face a gop filibuster
mcconnell said at the time he made the offer so democrats would fully own the decision to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the debt  


  

“democrats are simply voicing their expectations for something that already happened in the past to happen again” one senate republican aide said of the calls by aguilar and jayapal to get involved in the debt limit talks 



		health insurance for 600000 americans at stake in debt ceiling debate	


the gop aide noted mcconnell initially took a hard line against raising the debt limit while biden was in office sending a letter to the president warning “i will not be a party to any future effort to mitigate the consequences of democratic mismanagement” and that democratic leaders “cannot invent another crisis and ask for my help” 
“i get that mcconnell doesn’t want to be the main guy in this fight” the aide said “but jayapal wouldn’t be calling on somebody to get involved unless she thought that person would push for a clean debt ceiling hike because that’s her position” 
mcconnell has warned repeatedly this year that he will stay out of the debt limit negotiations entirely 
he told the wall street journal in an interview last week he agreed in january that mccarthy would be the republican point person in the negotiations  
“the two of us agreed from the beginning that it was important for him to take the lead” he said  
yet senate democrats are also rooting for mcconnell to step in to prevent a default which appears more possible with each passing day as biden and mccarthy remain far apart on a potential deal 
sen tim kaine dva told reporters earlier this month he felt “slightly better” about avoiding a fiscal catastrophe after mcconnell declared “the united states is not going to default it never has and it never will”  

sen tim kaine dva speaks to a reporter near the senate chamber during a series of votes regarding nominations on tuesday may 2 2023
mcconnell made those comments outside the white house after a meeting with biden and mccarthy  
the senate gop leader tried to reassure the media and the financial markets again tuesday and emphasized it would be up to the president and speaker not himself to work out a deal   
“i think everybody needs to relax” mcconnell told reporters in kentucky   
“regardless of what may be said about the talks … the president and the speaker will reach an agreement it will ultimately pass on a bipartisan vote in both the house and the senate” he said “the country will not default” 
mcconnell himself has argued any debt limit deal reached in the senate wouldn’t have a chance of passing the gopcontrolled house 
yet democrats are betting that mcconnell will be forced to intervene at the last moment once the nation is on the brink of default threatening chaos in the financial markets and a recessionjust as he did most famously in summer 2011 when thenpresident obama and thenspeaker john boehner rohio were at loggerheads over raising the debt limit  
“i understand the convenience of passing the buck in this building but in the end sen mcconnell always has his own opinion” sen chris murphy dconn told the hill earlier this month “he doesn’t outsource his opinions and votes to speaker mccarthy”

MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Thursday called on Hispanic people in Florida to vote against Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who launched his 2024 White House bid the day before, because of his immigration policies.
“Hopefully Hispanics in Florida will wake up and not give him one single vote, to not vote for those who persecute migrants, those who don’t respect migrants,” López Obrador said.


  

Speaking at his daily hours-long press conference, López Obrador addressed DeSantis’s political future, saying the governor had “uncovered” himself, using Mexican political slang for a candidate’s announcement, and taking credit for predicting DeSantis’s presidential run.
“As you can see I wasn’t wrong that all his politicking over migrants was because he wanted to be the Republican Party’s candidate,” López Obrador said.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks during the North America Summit, at the National Palace in Mexico City, Jan. 10, 2023.
At his Wednesday press conference, López Obrador had bemoaned the politics behind border security and immigration in the United States.
“We have to be thinking about this regrettable phenomenon of necessary migration, used with political ends in the United States,” he said, responding to a question from The Hill.
“The governor of Texas, campaigning, [saying] he will militarize the border and that he will continue building [the] wall; and the governor of Florida, the same, because he wants to be the Republican Party candidate and he’s politicking.”


  

DeSantis has increasingly leaned on the immigration and border security debate, despite Florida’s distance from the U.S.-Mexico border.

Under DeSantis, Florida has also sent law enforcement aid to Texas.

Last year, 58 percent of the state’s Hispanic voters swung toward DeSantis in his reelection campaign, according to CNN exit poll data analyzed by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas.
According to that analysis, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) lost the demographic by 2 percentage points in the 2006 election, but won it by a 15-point margin in the 2022 election.
Rubio won more than 67 percent of Hispanics of Cuban heritage and 51 percent of those without Cuban heritage.


  

He also won majorities among both men and women and among every age group except voters ages 18 to 29, 56 percent of whom voted for his challenger, former Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.).

House lawmakers are leaving Washington for the long holiday weekend Thursday afternoon — just one week before the Treasury Department says the U.S. is at risk of a debt default — without a deal to raise the debt ceiling.
Negotiators say they’re getting closer to striking a deal to avert a default next week, but an agreement didn’t appear imminent Thursday.


  

Leaving the Capitol Thursday night, McCarthy said the two sides had not yet reached an agreement.
“We’ve been talking to the White House all day, we’re going back and forth, and it’s not easy,” he said. “We want to make sure this is an agreement worthy of the American people, and so it takes a while to make it happen and we’re working hard to make it happen.”
The Speaker said he will be working from the Capitol this weekend.
“The update here is that the work continues. I think there’s a sense of understanding from both teams that we have serious issues still to work out and come to terms with, and that’s gonna take some time. That’s all there is to it,” Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a key ally of Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and negotiator in spending talks with the White House, said as he walked into McCarthy’s office earlier.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) speaks to reporters concerning the debt ceiling negotiations on the steps of the Capitol, Thursday, May 25, 2023.
At the same time, Democrats have been piling the criticism onto House GOP leaders for greenlighting the scheduled recess with the fiscal deadline looming.


  

“It’s just the weirdest thing to be going home in the middle of an impending disaster,” Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.) told The Hill on Thursday.
House GOP leaders said Wednesday that members could leave as scheduled Thursday but should be prepared to return to the Capitol to vote on legislation to raise the debt limit with 24 hours notice. 
Tensions are beginning to reach a fever pitch on both sides, as liberals and conservatives alike fret about what concessions a final agreement will contain.

While Democratic leaders face increased calls from their members to reject GOP-backed spending cuts, hard-line conservatives have pressed their leadership to remain firm in its efforts to achieve significant reforms. 
The bill passed by House Republicans last month would raise the debt limit through next March, at the latest, in exchange for capping government funding for fiscal 2024 at fiscal 2022 levels and limiting spending grown to 1 percent each year for a decade, along with a host of other conservative priorities.
Both sides have indicated, however, that a final bipartisan agreement will likely be much narrower in scope, as leaders focus on areas such as work requirements for social safety net programs, unallocated coronavirus funding and spending caps.


  

McCarthy has expressed confidence that the final deal would be able to notch significant support within his conference, and the party is largely unified behind the leader’s strategy in talks.

But there are concerns from some conservatives about what the final deal will look like. 


  

In comments to reporters Thursday, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) applauded the Speaker and GOP negotiators for their work leading talks for the Republican side over the past few weeks. But he also cautioned against the party taking an “exit ramp five exits too early.”
A group of 35 House Freedom Caucus members and allies, meanwhile, released a letter Thursday calling for McCarthy to push for additional conservative priorities, demanding to see how Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen determined a default could come on June 1 and suggesting passing COVID-19 funding clawbacks and repealing an IRS funding boost as a way to push back the deadline.

On the other side of the aisle, Democrats are also locking arms behind President Biden amid negotiations. However, there are questions about how much Democratic support the debt limit deal will be able to muster, as liberals come out in strong opposition to tougher work requirements for federal assistance programs and reduced nondefense funding. 


  

“I think the president has been trying to talk to them, but time is running out,” Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said this week.
“He won the White House because of a diverse vibrant coalition across the country and particularly in key states,” Jayapal said. “What we’ve said to the White House is to understand that we need to make sure that our vibrant, diverse coalition, represented by so many of the members in the Progressive Caucus, continue to be enthusiastic.”
Heading into the recess, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) accused Republicans of threatening to tank the economy because they think it might hurt Biden and the Democrats politically.


  

Democrats “are unified in working to avoid a dangerous default, which is what extreme MAGA Republicans are clearly determined to bring about,” Jeffries said, “because they have concluded that if they crash the economy, it will benefit them politically.
“That’s a sick way of thinking.”

A group of 35 House Republicans, made up of members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and their allies, are upping the pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in debt ceiling negotiations and proposing funding clawbacks they say could push a potential default date back through the end of June. 
In a letter to McCarthy, the lawmakers ask him to demand additions to the House GOP debt limit bill if the White House wants to raise the debt limit by a larger amount than was in the legislation and to demand Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen show how she determined a debt default could come as soon as June 1. They also propose combining and quickly passing clawbacks of unused COVID-19 funds and a repeal of a boost to IRS funding, which they say would push back a potential default through the month of June.


  

“Press reports indicate [President Biden] is pushing to water down the provisions of the House-passed Limit, Save, Grow Act while simultaneously demanding a debt ceiling increase of $4 trillion or more (well beyond the $1.5 trillion in the House bill),” they wrote. “This is outrageous.”
The letter comes as White House and House GOP negotiators appear to be inching closer to a compromise deal to raise the debt ceiling and cut some spending, though the details are unclear and could change.
“I think we’ve been close for six or seven days,” Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), one of McCarthy’s deputies negotiating a deal with the White House, told reporters on Thursday. “The issues are thorny. They’re difficult.”
The letter suggested McCarthy, in addition to demanding every provision in the House GOP debt limit increase and spending cut bill, should also ask for the addition of a border security bill and a repeal of funding for a new proposed FBI headquarters.
McCarthy has previously indicated he will not add border security to his debt limit asks and has said negotiations are operating off what is in the House GOP debt limit bill.
The note then casts doubt on Yellen’s debt ceiling projections.


  

“We should demand publicly and in your negotiations that the Treasury immediately furnish a complete justification of the June 1 projection and the exact fiscal situation expected thereafter, including Treasury’s payment prioritization plan,” the letter said.
The last proposal to suggest a clawback of COVID and IRS funds, the letter said, would “relieve the time pressure surrounding the ‘X-date’” and “enable the House to advance FY2024 appropriations in line with the FY2022 topline discretionary level set forth in the Limit, Save Grow Act.”

But McCarthy has shown no willingness to see the deadline pressure alleviated, and some Republicans note that pressure will help the White House and House GOP get to a deal.


  

The 35 signers include House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fa.). 
The message also got some interest from a more moderate House Republican who did not sign the letter. Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) tweeted of the largely Freedom Caucus letter: “They might be on to something.”

The GOP is pushing to cut IRS enforcement funding as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling, when doing so will actually add to the national debt, according to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates.
Republicans have railed against the additional $80 billion Democrats awarded to the IRS as part of the Inflation Reduction Act last year, and now they’re prioritizing its repeal over reducing the deficit.


  

In a memo sent to colleagues on Wednesday, House Budget Committee member Chip Roy (R-Texas) doubled down on the demand to take away the funds.
“Recouping these funds will not only save billions in inflationary spending right now, it also reduces the size of a weaponized agency and protects hardworking American families and businesses,” Roy wrote to fellow Republicans in the memo, which took issue with other Biden administration policies for being “deficit increasing.”
The CBO estimated last year that the increased funding for the IRS would result in $180.4 billion in additional revenue for the U.S. government over the next decade.
And new research suggests the additional IRS funding may be even more effective at reducing the national deficit than previously thought.
The cancellation of the IRS funding boost was also a condition for raising the debt ceiling, included in a GOP bill that passed the House earlier this month.
That bill nixes $45 billion for audits and $25 billion for operations, while preserving allotments of $3 billion for taxpayer services and $4.75 billion for a technology update.


  

The House-passed bill also cancels the funding for a formal study of an IRS-run online tax filing system, which the IRS has already completed and used to build a prototype that will be piloted during the 2024 tax filing system.
Tax experts say the $45 billion for enforcement will go the furthest toward reducing the national deficit, which now stands at $31.4 trillion. That’s about 120 percent of what the U.S. economy actually produces in a year, as measured by the ratio between debt and gross domestic product (GDP).
The government fails to collect around $600 billion in taxes it’s owed each year — an amount known as the “tax gap” that former IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said could actually be as high as $1 trillion annually, if measured with greater accuracy.


  

One of the biggest chunks of that money, at roughly $130 billion, lies in uncollected personal business income, which is often made by companies classified as S-corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships.
Auditing entities like that, which can be bundled and nested within one another by lawyers to make them even more opaque to federal authorities, requires skilled accountants and data analysts, which the IRS is in the process of hiring. Salary requirements for these auditors are a big part of why Democrats say the agency needs all the extra money.
Debt-to-GDP has increased in three major phases since the last time the U.S. ran a surplus in the early 2000s — once after the dot-com recession, once after the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, and again after the coronavirus pandemic.


  

While federal spending has remained roughly around 20 percent of GDP for decades, it spiked to 25 percent in 2009 and above 30 percent during the height of the pandemic. It has since come back down below 25 percent as various pandemic-related support programs for the public have been dismantled and allowed to lapse.
Republicans, who passed massive tax cuts that contributed to the federal deficit during their past two presidential administrations, have not considered any revenue raisers while negotiating to increase the debt ceiling. On the contrary, Republicans are pursuing additional extensions of those tax cuts that could add a further $3.45 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.
Instead, Republicans have insisted solely on spending cuts in the current showdown.


  

“The problem is, we’re spending more than almost any time in modern history. So it’s a spending problem,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday night. “You owe more money on the credit card than you make in an entire year. Because that’s what we have as Americans. We owe more than our entire economy is [worth].”
Cuts outlined in the Republican debt bill range from taking back unclaimed coronavirus relief money in a swath of pandemic-era spending packages to nixing tax credits and subsidies for environmentally friendly technologies advanced in a number of Biden administration policies.
Programs to increase renewable energy are a particular point of consternation for Republicans, who roundly fail to acknowledge the rapidly deteriorating conditions of Earth’s climate and environment that are associated with global warming and industrial production.


  

“Democrats’ latest green subsidy scheme will cost more than promised. Not only will their tax dollars go towards billion-dollar corporations, they will also flow to Chinese entities of concern and put American workers at a disadvantage,” Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) wrote in a one-pager released along with the GOP bill.
But the broader focus on limiting spending runs deep in Republican thinking.
When Medicare Part D legislation passed in November 2003 — during the George W. Bush administration — without a dedicated payroll tax, former Treasury official Bruce Bartlett said he was mortified.


  

“At the time, I thought that the reason Republicans — and I was a Republican in those days — were put on this Earth, was to control entitlement programs. And I was appalled that an entirely new entitlement program was created that was completely unfunded. It raised the deficit forever by about 1 percent of GDP,” Bartlett testified to the Senate Budget Committee earlier this month.
Republican ire toward the IRS runs just as deep these days. The first measure passed by the newly elected Republican-led House in January also terminated the Democrats’ $80 billion IRS funding boost, targeting the exact provisions as those canceled by the GOP debt limit bill.
“[The IRS] should be focused on providing quality service to taxpayers. Rescinding the funding for 87,000 new IRS agents is a great first step in that direction, and I was happy to vote ‘yes’ on this legislation!” Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) said in January.
But the additional IRS funding and more focus on enforcement could lower the deficit more than previously thought.
Researchers with the IRS and Yale School of Management recently found the “behavioral response” of taxpayers toward greater levels of enforcement and the threat of future enforcement could bring in three times as much money as the CBO currently estimates and up to $1 trillion annually.
“The lack of any real enforcement presence for large groups of business entities impacts not only direct tax revenue collected but also taxpayer behavior and taxpayer morale in meaningful ways. In essence, not having a tax cop on the beat engenders more malfeasance in a way that the agency must address to prevent further erosion of tax compliance,” the authors wrote in a paper published earlier this month.

“Lack of an enforcement presence can also spur activity into segments of the economy because the limited enforcement presence gives an economic advantage to certain sectors or business forms that facilitate tax evasion, and it can place compliant taxpayers at a competitive disadvantage,” they continued.
Different parts of the economy are compliant with tax laws to different degrees. Workers and employees are the most law-abiding segment, reporting their wages and salaries with 99 percent accuracy, while business owners are far less tax law-abiding.
Among the least compliant sectors are farmers, whose income is subject to “little or no information reporting,” according to the IRS. Sixty-four percent of all farm income is misreported to the IRS, while business owners in sectors other than agriculture report their income with only 43 percent accuracy.

the gop is pushing to cut irs enforcement funding as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling when doing so will actually add to the national debt according to congressional budget office cbo estimates
republicans have railed against the additional 80 billion democrats awarded to the irs as part of the inflation reduction act last year and now they’re prioritizing its repeal over reducing the deficit


  

in a memo sent to colleagues on wednesday house budget committee member chip roy rtexas doubled down on the demand to take away the funds
“recouping these funds will not only save billions in inflationary spending right now it also reduces the size of a weaponized agency and protects hardworking american families and businesses” roy wrote to fellow republicans in the memo which took issue with other biden administration policies for being “deficit increasing”
the cbo estimated last year that the increased funding for the irs would result in 1804 billion in additional revenue for the us government over the next decade
and new research suggests the additional irs funding may be even more effective at reducing the national deficit than previously thought
the cancellation of the irs funding boost was also a condition for raising the debt ceiling included in a gop bill that passed the house earlier this month
that bill nixes 45 billion for audits and 25 billion for operations while preserving allotments of 3 billion for taxpayer services and 475 billion for a technology update


  

the housepassed bill also cancels the funding for a formal study of an irsrun online tax filing system which the irs has already completed and used to build a prototype that will be piloted during the 2024 tax filing system
tax experts say the 45 billion for enforcement will go the furthest toward reducing the national deficit which now stands at 314 trillion that’s about 120 percent of what the us economy actually produces in a year as measured by the ratio between debt and gross domestic product gdp
the government fails to collect around 600 billion in taxes it’s owed each yearan amount known as the “tax gap” that former irs commissioner charles rettig said could actually be as high as 1 trillion annually if measured with greater accuracy


  

one of the biggest chunks of that money at roughly 130 billion lies in uncollected personal business income which is often made by companies classified as scorporations limited liability companies and partnerships
auditing entities like that which can be bundled and nested within one another by lawyers to make them even more opaque to federal authorities requires skilled accountants and data analysts which the irs is in the process of hiring salary requirements for these auditors are a big part of why democrats say the agency needs all the extra money
debttogdp has increased in three major phases since the last time the us ran a surplus in the early 2000sonce after the dotcom recession once after the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 and again after the coronavirus pandemic


  

while federal spending has remained roughly around 20 percent of gdp for decades it spiked to 25 percent in 2009 and above 30 percent during the height of the pandemic it has since come back down below 25 percent as various pandemicrelated support programs for the public have been dismantled and allowed to lapse
republicans who passed massive tax cuts that contributed to the federal deficit during their past two presidential administrations have not considered any revenue raisers while negotiating to increase the debt ceiling on the contrary republicans are pursuing additional extensions of those tax cuts that could add a further 345 trillion to the deficit over the next decade
instead republicans have insisted solely on spending cuts in the current showdown


  

“the problem is we’re spending more than almost any time in modern history so it’s a spending problem” house speaker kevin mccarthy rcalif said monday night “you owe more money on the credit card than you make in an entire year because that’s what we have as americans we owe more than our entire economy is worth”

Nearly a year ago, I warned in these pages that Israel and Iran were rapidly reaching an inflection point over Tehran’s intent to weaponize its nuclear program. In June 2022, Iran was reported to already have amassed 95 pounds of highly enriched uranium to a 60 percent level — well beyond the amount of mass needed for an atomic weapon, yet still short of the 90 percent enrichment required for an Armageddon-like detonation. 
Now, according to a February 2023 official International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report to the United Nations Security Council, Iran has portentously amassed a stockpile of 193 pounds of U-235 enriched to 60 percent, or enough mass to produce three full-scale atomic weapons. It has also, alarmingly, demonstrated a menacing capacity to enrich U-235 particles to 83.7 percent. Equally disconcerting was “two cascades of IR-6 centrifuges at Iran’s Fordo facility” were “configured” to facilitate reaching a weaponized grade of 90 percent.


  

Iran clearly knows now how to unlock the doors to a nuclear Armageddon. There is a growing sense in Israel that Jerusalem is quickly running out of time to prevent Iran from becoming a regional nuclear power. Moreover, it is highly likely that, as part of Tehran’s partnership to supply Russian President Vladimir Putin with drones for use in Ukraine, Moscow is helping Iran overcome the last of several remaining technical obstacles to producing, weaponizing, delivering and detonating a nuclear bomb.
“Particles” are not the same as highly enriched uranium. However, like a dying canary in a coal mine, their enrichment is an unmistakable signal to the Israeli Defense Force that the endgame is fast approaching a now-or-never reckoning. Acting will not be easy, nor is decisive success a given. Many of Iran’s nuclear sites are as far as 1,500 miles east of Tel Aviv, including Iran’s purported atomic test site in the Lutz Desert. 
In 1981, Israel launched Operation Babylon, which successfully destroyed Saddam Hussein’s Osirak nuclear facility then under construction. That required a single 2,000-mile aerial trip. Now, in direct contrast, there are at least seven major known Iranian nuclear sites spanning the country, including Bushehr, which is being built in partnership with Russia, the Natanz Enrichment Plant, and the Isfahan Nuclear Fuel Research and Production Center. Beyond doubt, there are other critical facilities that would have to be struck by the Israeli Air Force to sufficiently degrade Iran’s capacity to build and launch nuclear weapons.
Jerusalem, since early 2021, has increasingly publicly signaled to Tehran a willingness and readiness to do just that. Then-Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi, the Israeli Defense Force’s Army Chief of Staff, openly declared that Israel had “dramatically accelerated” funding and plans for an attack on Iran’s nuclear installations, enrichment sites and research centers. Subsequently, in a highly unusual move for the normally secretive Israeli government when it comes to the nation’s military capabilities, Jerusalem leaked in August 2022 that its stealth F-35 fighter bombers had “repeatedly” and successfully “penetrated Iranian airspace.”
Washington, hesitatingly, is trying to help Jerusalem ratchet up the pressure on Tehran, agreeing to the “massive joint military exercise in Israel” earlier in January codenamed Juniper Oak 23.2. More than 6,000 U.S. soldiers joined 1,100 IDF forces in maneuvers involving 142 coalition aircraft. However, despite the overt threats to U.S. national security interests in the Middle East and elsewhere a nuclear armed Iran would pose, the Biden administration is seemingly still mired in the false promise of continued diplomacy with Iran. 
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has repeatedly tried to revive the Obama administration’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of October 2015, which President Donald Trump terminated three years later in May 2018. But in spite of Sullivan’s efforts, Iran has only obfuscated and used the intervening time lost to negotiations to continue its nuclear program unbated. Sullivan has rather naively viewed diplomacy as an end to a means, but Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sees it as a means to ending Israel’s window of opportunity to stop Tehran from going nuclear.


  

Despite the February IAEA reports of Iran enriching U-235 particles to 83.7 percent — just a hop, skip and a jump from a weapons grade of 90 percent — Sullivan was still preaching deterrence and diplomacy earlier this month, during a less-than-inspiring address to The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Yes, Sullivan said all the right things, including that “Iran can never be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon.” But the net effect now is that Washington is like a dog chasing its own tail when it comes to stopping Iran’s accelerating nuclear ambitions. 
Ironically, diplomacy is one of the main reasons why — not only in terms of this cat-and-mouse game with Tehran, but also in that the Biden administration has been repeatedly outfoxed by Chinese President Xi Jinping when it comes to Iran. This is nowhere more evident than in Xi’s success in peeling off Saudi Arabia and facilitating Riyadh’s renewed diplomatic ties with Tehran. In his speech, Sullivan unconvincingly tried to spin that setback as a positive, claiming the Biden administration “stayed in close touch with the Saudis” until the “deal [was] reached.”

		It’s time to pump the brakes on the government eviction machine	

If Iran has unlocked the gates to Armageddon, then diplomacy, no matter how hard Sullivan may push for it, is rapidly running out of time, if not on empty. Stronger, decisive military measures are increasingly becoming the only viable option. Already, Israel appears to be in the beginning stages of prepping for an attack on Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet has launched a series of air strikes on Iranian backed militia and forces, including Islamic Jihad in Gaza, a Hamas faction in Lebanon, and Iranian military advisors in Syria. 


  

Is this a prelude to something? Quite possibly. If and when Jerusalem acts militarily against Tehran to stop its nuclear ambitions, it will likely involve four different fronts, as Iranian-backed groups in Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza would immediately launch reprisal missile and rocket attacks on Israel. For now, however, only one thing is certain. Tehran has inserted the nuclear key into the gate lock of Armageddon and is beginning to twist it open.

nearly a year ago i warned in these pages that israel and iran were rapidly reaching an inflection point over tehran’s intent to weaponize its nuclear program in june 2022 iran was reported to already have amassed 95 pounds of highly enriched uranium to a 60 percent levelwell beyond the amount of mass needed for an atomic weapon yet still short of the 90 percent enrichment required for an armageddonlike detonation 
now according to a february 2023 official international atomic energy agency iaea report to the united nations security council iran has portentously amassed a stockpile of 193 pounds of u235 enriched to 60 percent or enough mass to produce three fullscale atomic weapons it has also alarmingly demonstrated a menacing capacity to enrich u235 particles to 837 percent equally disconcerting was “two cascades of ir6 centrifuges at iran’s fordo facility” were “configured” to facilitate reaching a weaponized grade of 90 percent


  

iran clearly knows now how to unlock the doors to a nuclear armageddon there is a growing sense in israel that jerusalem is quickly running out of time to prevent iran from becoming a regional nuclear power moreover it is highly likely that as part of tehran’s partnership to supply russian president vladimir putin with drones for use in ukraine moscow is helping iran overcome the last of several remaining technical obstacles to producing weaponizing delivering and detonating a nuclear bomb
“particles” are not the same as highly enriched uranium however like a dying canary in a coal mine their enrichment is an unmistakable signal to the israeli defense force that the endgame is fast approaching a nowornever reckoning acting will not be easy nor is decisive success a given many of iran’s nuclear sites are as far as 1500 miles east of tel aviv including iran’s purported atomic test site in the lutz desert 
in 1981 israel launched operation babylon which successfully destroyed saddam hussein’s osirak nuclear facility then under construction that required a single 2000mile aerial trip now in direct contrast there are at least seven major known iranian nuclear sites spanning the country including bushehr which is being built in partnership with russia the natanz enrichment plant and the isfahan nuclear fuel research and production center beyond doubt there are other critical facilities that would have to be struck by the israeli air force to sufficiently degrade iran’s capacity to build and launch nuclear weapons
jerusalem since early 2021 has increasingly publicly signaled to tehran a willingness and readiness to do just that thenlt gen aviv kohavi the israeli defense force’s army chief of staff openly declared that israel had “dramatically accelerated” funding and plans for an attack on iran’s nuclear installations enrichment sites and research centers subsequently in a highly unusual move for the normally secretive israeli government when it comes to the nation’s military capabilities jerusalem leaked in august 2022 that its stealth f35 fighter bombers had “repeatedly” and successfully “penetrated iranian airspace”
washington hesitatingly is trying to help jerusalem ratchet up the pressure on tehran agreeing to the “massive joint military exercise in israel” earlier in january codenamed juniper oak 232 more than 6000 us soldiers joined 1100 idf forces in maneuvers involving 142 coalition aircraft however despite the overt threats to us national security interests in the middle east and elsewhere a nuclear armed iran would pose the biden administration is seemingly still mired in the false promise of continued diplomacy with iran 
national security advisor jake sullivan has repeatedly tried to revive the obama administration’s joint comprehensive plan of action of october 2015 which president donald trump terminated three years later in may 2018 but in spite of sullivan’s efforts iran has only obfuscated and used the intervening time lost to negotiations to continue its nuclear program unbated sullivan has rather naively viewed diplomacy as an end to a means but iran’s supreme leader ali khamenei sees it as a means to ending israel’s window of opportunity to stop tehran from going nuclear


  

despite the february iaea reports of iran enriching u235 particles to 837 percentjust a hop skip and a jump from a weapons grade of 90 percentsullivan was still preaching deterrence and diplomacy earlier this month during a lessthaninspiring address to the washington institute for near east policy yes sullivan said all the right things including that “iran can never be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon” but the net effect now is that washington is like a dog chasing its own tail when it comes to stopping iran’s accelerating nuclear ambitions 
ironically diplomacy is one of the main reasons whynot only in terms of this catandmouse game with tehran but also in that the biden administration has been repeatedly outed by chinese president xi jinping when it comes to iran this is nowhere more evident than in xi’s success in peeling off saudi arabia and facilitating riyadh’s renewed diplomatic ties with tehran in his speech sullivan unconvincingly tried to spin that setback as a positive claiming the biden administration “stayed in close touch with the saudis” until the “deal was reached”


		the protest for iranian women didn’t end the world is ignoring it	

		it’s time to pump the brakes on the government eviction machine	

if iran has unlocked the gates to armageddon then diplomacy no matter how hard sullivan may push for it is rapidly running out of time if not on empty stronger decisive military measures are increasingly becoming the only viable option already israel appears to be in the beginning stages of prepping for an attack on iran israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and his cabinet has launched a series of air strikes on iranian backed militia and forces including islamic jihad in gaza a hamas faction in lebanon and iranian military advisors in syria 


  

is this a prelude to something quite possibly if and when jerusalem acts militarily against tehran to stop its nuclear ambitions it will likely involve four different fronts as iranianbacked groups in syria lebanon and gaza would immediately launch reprisal missile and rocket attacks on israel for now however only one thing is certain tehran has inserted the nuclear key into the gate lock of armageddon and is beginning to twist it open

Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, left, joins Chairman Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., at a hearing on the Republican proposal to address the debt … [+4855 chars]","

Senators on the Budget Committee squabbled Tuesday over the root causes of the U.S. deficit as White House and congressional negotiators conduct last-minute talks to avoid a precedent-breaking default on the country’s debt.
While senators in both parties wrung their hands over the shortfall, Democrats focused almost exclusively on revenue shortages engendered by Republican tax cuts, and GOP senators targeted excessive spending in domestic programs.


  

“Together, the Bush and Trump tax cuts have added $10 trillion to the debt, and they account for 57 percent of the increase in debt-to-GDP ratio since 2001. But for those tax cuts, our debt would actually be declining as a share of the economy,” Budget Committee Chairman Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said.
Whitehouse called out what he described as a familiar pattern on the part of Republicans: “Giant tax cuts that benefit wealthy and corporate donors, and debt limit hikes.” 
The debt limit was raised three times under former President Trump, he noted.
“The problem isn’t tax cuts,” ranking member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) countered, reminding Whitehouse of bipartisan support for prior tax cuts. “The problem is unchecked spending.”
Senators stuck largely to partisan talking points, not finding common ground on tackling the significantly larger drivers of the ballooning federal debt.
U.S. federal debt levels are a consequence of not collecting enough tax revenue to pay for the country’s services, including health care, pensions, the military and education, in addition to interest payments made to debt holders. Total U.S. debt stock is now about $31 trillion, which is more than U.S. annual gross domestic product.


  

The partisan sparring over the impact of tax cuts reflected the deep divides driving the U.S. closer to a potentially catastrophic default.
Republicans are currently seeking to make many of the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, including business-specific cuts relating to interest deductibility and bonus depreciation.
Democrats, on the other hand, have been aiming for major expansions of pricey spending programs that include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which lifted millions of children out of poverty during the pandemic.


  

Both objectives are directly at odds with addressing the long-term issue of the federal deficit. In the short-term, the debt ceiling impasse is generating increasing scorn from commentators.
“The US debt ceiling farce continues, with President Biden to cut short an international trip to see if congressional leaders are prepared to behave like adults over the issue,” UBS economist Paul Donovan wrote in a Wednesday note to investors. 
“If Congress behaved like adults, the debt ceiling would be eradicated permanently. More likely Congress will behave like surly teenagers, kicking the can down the road with a muttered ‘whatever,’” he wrote.


  

Commentary during the hearing from budgetary experts, most of whom fell neatly into Republican and Democratic ideological niches, did converge upon questioning from Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on the truism that tax cuts do not “pay for themselves” — a phrase often repeated by politicians about the stimulative benefits of reducing taxes.
“The Tax Foundation modeled every iteration of what became the [Trump Administration’s] Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the beginning to the end, and at no time did our model ever predict that it would pay for itself,” Scott Hodge, president emeritus of the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank, told senators. 
“Our model is perhaps the most sophisticated in Washington, and it does not estimate that virtually any tax cut will pay for itself,” he said.

As measured by the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio, the federal deficit has increased sharply three times since the last period of U.S. budgetary surplus at the end of the 1990s, lining up generally with periods of U.S. economic contraction.
It spiked in 2001, aligning with the Bush-era tax cuts that reduced the top four income tax rates as well as the rate on capital gains and dividends, and further propelled by the dot-com recession.
It spiked again in the wake of 2007-08 financial crisis and recession, which slashed revenues as output slowed. It started increasing once more following the Trump tax cuts of 2017 before falling off a cliff in 2020 due to the flash recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, from which it has mostly recovered.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) saw both of his endorsed candidates lose their races Tuesday, while the Florida governor is rumored to be readying for a possible presidential bid.
DeSantis stepped into the Kentucky GOP’s gubernatorial primary to back former U.N. ambassador Kelly Craft, endorsing Craft on election day. 


  

As polling in the run-up to the election had projected, Craft lost the primary race to state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who was backed by former President Trump. 
Trump is running to retake the presidency in 2024 — and though DeSantis hasn’t officially launched a bid, he’s considered the top potential Trump challenger and is expected to get in the race. 
Democrats also flipped control of the Jacksonville, Fla., mayor’s office, with Democrat Donna Deegan defeating Republican Daniel Davis to succeed Mayor Lenny Curry (R). DeSantis had also backed Davis in the race. 
DeSantis said over the weekend that the GOP needs to “reject the culture of losing that has infected our party in recent years.”

Former President Trump took a victory lap Wednesday, taunting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) after two of the governor’s endorsees lost their races Tuesday night.
Trump endorsed Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R), who beat out DeSantis-backed former U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft in the state’s GOP gubernatorial primary. Cameron placed first, Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles placed second and Craft placed third.


  

DeSantis also backed Republican candidate Daniel Davis in the Jacksonville, Fla. mayoral race, who lost to Democrat Donna Deegan. 
“Congratulations to a ‘star’ in Kentucky, Danial Cameron,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, misspelling the candidate’s name. “[He] easily won the Republican Nomination for Governor. He had my Complete and Total Endorsement.”
“The DeSanctimonious backed candidate came in a DISTANT third. Ron’s magic is GONE! He also lost, shockingly, in Jacksonville last night (Mayor),” he added, using the belittling nickname he’s given DeSantis.
Trump claimed in a separate post that had Davis asked Trump for his endorsement, “he would have won, easily”

DeSantis is expected to officially launch a 2024 White House bid in the coming weeks and is seen as the Trump’s chief rival for the GOP nomination. 


  

The former president has ramped up his attack on DeSantis in recent weeks, calling the Florida governor nicknames and taunting him over the number of House Republicans endorsing the former president.

Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, left, joins Chairman Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., at a hearing on the Republican proposal to address the debt … [+4855 chars]","

Senators on the Budget Committee squabbled Tuesday over the root causes of the U.S. deficit as White House and congressional negotiators conduct last-minute talks to avoid a precedent-breaking default on the country’s debt.
While senators in both parties wrung their hands over the shortfall, Democrats focused almost exclusively on revenue shortages engendered by Republican tax cuts, and GOP senators targeted excessive spending in domestic programs.


  

“Together, the Bush and Trump tax cuts have added $10 trillion to the debt, and they account for 57 percent of the increase in debt-to-GDP ratio since 2001. But for those tax cuts, our debt would actually be declining as a share of the economy,” Budget Committee Chairman Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said.
Whitehouse called out what he described as a familiar pattern on the part of Republicans: “Giant tax cuts that benefit wealthy and corporate donors, and debt limit hikes.” 
The debt limit was raised three times under former President Trump, he noted.
“The problem isn’t tax cuts,” ranking member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) countered, reminding Whitehouse of bipartisan support for prior tax cuts. “The problem is unchecked spending.”
Senators stuck largely to partisan talking points, not finding common ground on tackling the significantly larger drivers of the ballooning federal debt.
U.S. federal debt levels are a consequence of not collecting enough tax revenue to pay for the country’s services, including health care, pensions, the military and education, in addition to interest payments made to debt holders. Total U.S. debt stock is now about $31 trillion, which is more than U.S. annual gross domestic product.


  

The partisan sparring over the impact of tax cuts reflected the deep divides driving the U.S. closer to a potentially catastrophic default.
Republicans are currently seeking to make many of the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, including business-specific cuts relating to interest deductibility and bonus depreciation.
Democrats, on the other hand, have been aiming for major expansions of pricey spending programs that include the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which lifted millions of children out of poverty during the pandemic.


  

Both objectives are directly at odds with addressing the long-term issue of the federal deficit. In the short-term, the debt ceiling impasse is generating increasing scorn from commentators.
“The US debt ceiling farce continues, with President Biden to cut short an international trip to see if congressional leaders are prepared to behave like adults over the issue,” UBS economist Paul Donovan wrote in a Wednesday note to investors. 
“If Congress behaved like adults, the debt ceiling would be eradicated permanently. More likely Congress will behave like surly teenagers, kicking the can down the road with a muttered ‘whatever,’” he wrote.


  

Commentary during the hearing from budgetary experts, most of whom fell neatly into Republican and Democratic ideological niches, did converge upon questioning from Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) on the truism that tax cuts do not “pay for themselves” — a phrase often repeated by politicians about the stimulative benefits of reducing taxes.
“The Tax Foundation modeled every iteration of what became the [Trump Administration’s] Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the beginning to the end, and at no time did our model ever predict that it would pay for itself,” Scott Hodge, president emeritus of the right-leaning Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank, told senators. 
“Our model is perhaps the most sophisticated in Washington, and it does not estimate that virtually any tax cut will pay for itself,” he said.

As measured by the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio, the federal deficit has increased sharply three times since the last period of U.S. budgetary surplus at the end of the 1990s, lining up generally with periods of U.S. economic contraction.
It spiked in 2001, aligning with the Bush-era tax cuts that reduced the top four income tax rates as well as the rate on capital gains and dividends, and further propelled by the dot-com recession.
It spiked again in the wake of 2007-08 financial crisis and recession, which slashed revenues as output slowed. It started increasing once more following the Trump tax cuts of 2017 before falling off a cliff in 2020 due to the flash recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, from which it has mostly recovered.

The United Nations weather agency reported Wednesday that there is a 2 in 3 chance that the world will temporarily reach the temperature threshold to trigger the most severe effects of climate change. 
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported that there is a 66 percent chance that the world’s average near-surface temperature will increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial levels for at least one year during the next five years. 


  

The report also stated that there was a 98 percent chance that at least one of the years, as well as the five-year period, will be the warmest ever recorded. 
The 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold was set by the 2016 Paris climate agreement that aimed to prevent catastrophic global warming. The WMO noted that the chances of surpassing that threshold have been increasing since 2015.

“This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5°C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. “However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5°C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency.”
The report cited the upcoming El Niño climate patterns expected to occur in the next few months as contributing to the increase in temperatures. The El Niño is the warm phase of the climate pattern known as El Niño Southern Oscillation and will begin by late spring or early summer, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center.
“A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” Taalas said. “This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment. We need to be prepared.”
