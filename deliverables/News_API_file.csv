      The nation is days away from defaulting on its obligations. The Republican House speaker, pushed by conservatives in his party, demands deep spending cuts. The president, a Democrat, works on negotiating a package to avert a fiscal calamity.
  

      No, it’s not 2023. 
  

      It’s 2011, when then-President Barack Obama agreed to a debt ceiling deal with then-House Speaker John Boehner that called for more than $900 billion in upfront spending cuts and deficit reduction, as well as the creation of a joint congressional committee that would find at least $1.2 trillion in additional belt tightening.

Here’s what happened next.Analysis: Debt ceiling deal exposes Biden and McCarthy’s weaknesses with their parties’ extremes





      The situation is similar to the one President Joe Biden, who served as Obama’s vice president, is facing today. He and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, are pushing their parties to swiftly approve their agreement to address the current debt limit drama before the US could start missing payments on June 5.
  

      Today’s House Republicans may want to look back at the results of their predecessors’ hard-fought deal. Things didn’t proceed as planned, and a chunk of the reductions was ultimately pared back through a subsequent series of bipartisan bills.
  

      “Once Congress took a look at the programs and what was required, they realized they couldn’t make cuts that deep,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute who was involved in the 2011 negotiations.
  

    What happened after the 2011 deal was signed


      The joint committee in 2011 was tasked with finding additional deficit reduction measures to offset a $1.2 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. If members failed in their mission, automatic cuts that would slow the growth of expected spending would kick in over the next decade.

      The committee did not accomplish its goal, which triggered the spending caps, known as sequestration. 
  

      However, Congress then watered down the deficit reduction provisions by repeatedly increasing the caps on discretionary spending in the following years – though lawmakers also included other measures to offset some of those changes.
  

      “We basically unwound this bill little by little,” said John Diamond, director of the Center for Public Finance at Rice University’s Baker Institute.
  

      In the end, spending was curtailed by about $1.5 trillion out of the total $2.1 trillion agreed to in the 2011 deal, Riedl said. This included $855 billion in cuts to discretionary spending over the decade. The reductions affected agencies and programs, including defense, education, justice and the Internal Revenue Service, among others. The deal also slapped a 2% cut in payments to Medicare providers as part of reductions to mandatory spending programs.
  

    Today’s deal


      Fast forward to 2023. One of the major sticking points to ending the debt ceiling impasse was the depth of the spending cuts. The Biden administration had balked at returning spending to fiscal 2022 levels, which the Republicans included in their debt ceiling bill earlier this year, while McCarthy’s team held firm.

                CNN





      In the end, the deal announced over the weekend calls for non-defense discretionary spending to be pared back for fiscal 2024, but certain agreed-upon appropriation adjustments would make up nearly all of the difference. Non-defense spending would rise just 1% in fiscal 2025. 
  

      One important distinction between 2011 and today is that the spending caps back then were Plan B, said Warren Payne, a senior advisor at Mayer Brown, a law firm, who was a senior Republican staffer on the House Ways and Means Committee in 2011.
  

      “People were operating under the presumption that the spending caps would never actually happen,” Payne said.
  

      Now, the spending caps are among the GOP’s top priorities – and McCarthy succeeded in not limiting funding for defense and not raising taxes, unlike in 2011, he said.
  

      But even if Congress passes this debt ceiling package, House Republicans may find it difficult to adhere to the caps when it comes time to actually appropriate funding for the federal government’s operations later this year.
  

      “It’s reasonable to expect that at the end of the day, we would end up with the same pressures to increase spending,” Diamond said.

      As California Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped on stage at the state Democratic Party Convention this weekend, Vilma Dawson applauded with the visible faith of someone who had supported him through multiple elections and a recall campaign.
  

      Dawson does not expect her loyalty to Newsom will be tested in a politically fraught decision that may lie ahead – selecting a successor to fill the seat of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, should the 89-year-old, who has already announced she’s not running for reelection in 2024, resign before the end of her term.
  

      “I’m sure Governor Newsom has a plan to appoint an African American female,” said Dawson. Pausing to consider her words, she continued, “I don’t think the governorship is where he’s going to stop his political career. People have long memories as to whether they can trust someone to support, shall we say, promises that they made.”
  

      In 2021, Newsom had said, “The answer is yes,” when asked on MSNBC if he would nominate a Black woman for Feinstein’s seat. 
  

      After Feinstein was absent from the Senate for months due to a shingles diagnosis that resulted in complications of Ramsay Hunt syndrome and encephalitis, California Democrats gathered for their state convention with her health top of mind. 
  

      “We do believe that Governor Newsom will keep his promise. We have known him to be a man of his word,” said Kimberly Ellis, a Democratic strategist and activist in California.
  

      Ellis is part of an effort by Democratic Black women lobbying Newsom on the Senate choice, should he have to make it. Ellis described the effort as “putting our shoulder to the wheel – really trying to ensure that we get the best qualified person to lead us at this moment in time.”
  

      Two Black women have served in the US Senate – Carol Moseley Braun, who served from 1993 to 1996, and Kamala Harris, who left to join the Biden administration as vice president. Currently, there are no Black women senators.
  

      Citing battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Ellis said, “Black women are the margin of victory. We get it done. [Newsom] knows that just like many in the country know that. And so, we have no doubt that he will indeed appoint a Black woman. The only question that’s on the table is which Black woman.”
  

      Ellis thinks Rep. Barbara Lee should be first on Newsom’s list, calling her sentiment “Barbara or bust.”
  

      Lee has already declared her candidacy for the seat in 2024. 
  

      Greeting supporters at her booth at the party convention meeting, Lee said her campaign would be fueled by a “multi-generational, multi-racial, progressive coalition.”
  

      Calling the lack of Black women representation in the US Senate “outrageous,” Lee declined to press Newsom on any possible nomination choice. “I’m not going to get involved in his process,” she said. “He made a commitment. But I’m focused on this campaign. I am running to win this election.”
  

    A crowded Democratic field for 2024


      But choosing Lee wouldn’t be a simple choice for Newsom. The US Senate race is already underway, with three sitting members of Congress representing various factions of the Democratic Party in the race.
  

      Lee’s rivals include Reps. Adam Schiff and Katie Porter.
  

      Schiff is both a state and nationally known figure as the lead prosecutor in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial. He also has been endorsed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose involvement in the Senate race has opened up political intrigue.
  

      Pelosi’s eldest daughter, Nancy Corinne Prowda, was reported and later pictured around Feinstein as she returned to the Senate. The Pelosi and Feinstein families have been close friends for decades, but a Pelosi family member so closely assisting Feinstein led to further speculation about the political dealings around the Senate seat.
  

      “You can’t help but think about how it could impact your campaign,” Schiff said about Feinstein’s future and the wildcard it presents. “She’ll make a decision that she feels is consistent with her health and what’s best for the state.”
  

      Regarding the noise surrounding a possible Newsom appointment, Schiff said he was doing his best to ignore it. “My father gave me some very good advice, which is focus on the things you can control, not the things you can’t. I do think that ultimately, voters want to decide this race and they want that choice to make. And I think they will have that choice.”
  

      Porter, a favorite of California and national progressives, said, “I assume that Governor Newsom will keep his promise, but I can’t speak for him or what he’s thinking about,” adding that she was grateful for Feinstein’s return to Washington. 
  

      But she stressed that the campaign is about the future. “It’s not just about the next six months. It’s about the next six years and the next 60 years for California.”
  

      At an event honoring Black women at the state party convention, Patrice Marshall McKenzie of Pasadena called herself “cautiously optimistic, but not confident” that Newsom would deliver. “I’m trying to keep my expectations moderate so that there’s not an issue of being disappointed if there’s under deliverance.”
  

      Under-deliverance, for several Black women Democrats, would mean nominating a caretaker in the seat – either a non-political appointee or a politician who pledges not to run in 2024.
  

      Tracie Stafford, a Democratic activist from Sacramento, said she was bracing herself for disappointment should Feinstein step aside before the election.
  

      “The reality is, unfortunately, that there have not been ramifications for not keeping promises to specifically Black people and Black women,” she said. 
  

      “The reality is, where else are we going to vote? What else do we have, but our Democratic Party and our Democratic elected officials? We are absolutely between a rock and a hard place.”

         — 
    


      The Texas House’s impeachment of state Attorney General Ken Paxton on Saturday was the latest in a string of legal woes that began shortly after the Republican was first elected in 2014. 
  

      Paxton is a conservative firebrand who has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump. From his perch as Texas’ top prosecutor, he has led legal battles against former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and more. He challenged the 2020 election’s results in federal court, and in recent months has targeted Texas hospitals for providing transition-related care for transgender minors.
  

      Paxton, a former member of the Texas House and Senate, has denied any wrongdoing, and described his myriad of legal battles as politically motivated. 
  

      Here is a look Paxton’s tenure as Texas’ top prosecutor and the legal battles he has faced:
  

    2015 indictment


      Just months after taking office, a state grand jury indicted Paxton on securities fraud charges. Prosecutors said Paxton duped investors by selling shares of a technology company without registering as an investment adviser representative with the state board or disclosing that he was being paid by the company. 
  

      The case has still not gone to trial, and has been mired in disputes over judges, location and prosecutors’ pay. Paxton has called it a political witch hunt and denied wrongdoing. 
  

      Paxton was also accused of bribery after accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts from friends and donors to cover legal fees, but was not charged for doing so. 
  

    2018 reelection


      Amid the legal cloud, Paxton won a second term in 2018. He beat Democrat Justin Nelson by 3.6 percentage points.
  

    2020 whistleblower claims


      Seven top Paxton aides in 2020 publicly accused him of bribery and abusing his office. The aides, who also reported their allegations to the FBI, were all fired, put on leave or resigned.
  

      The whistleblowers had accused him of using his authority to benefit political friend Nate Paul, a real estate investor who had donated tens of thousands of dollars to Paxton’s campaign. 
  

      Federal prosecutors began an investigation shortly after the allegations were made, and Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section in Washington took over that probe this February. 
  

    2020 election lawsuit


      Paxton, a Trump loyalist, filed a federal lawsuit after President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election seeking to overturn four key swing states’ results. The US Supreme Court threw out Paxton’s lawsuit. Weeks later, Paxton appeared at the January 6, 2021, “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the riot at the US Capitol. 
  

      In 2022, the State Bar of Texas sued Paxton, accusing him of professional misconduct for claims of substantial voter fraud that the bar said were “misrepresentations and false statements.”  A Collin County district court judge earlier this year refused Paxton’s push to dismiss the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds.
  

    2022 reelection


      Paxton faced a crowded Republican primary field, including land commissioner George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in his bid for a third term. But he emerged unscathed, defeating Bush in a runoff by 36 percentage points and then defeating Democrat Rochelle Garza in November by nearly 10 points. 
  

    2023 settlement


      Paxton in February agreed to a $3.3 million settlement and an apology, but no admission of wrongdoing, with four of the whistleblowers. 
  

      However, it was Paxton’s request that the state legislature approve $3.3 million in government funds that triggered the General Investigating Committee of the Texas House to begin investigating those whistleblowers’ claims – a probe that would lead to Paxton’s impeachment at the five-member panel’s recommendation. 
  

    Impeachment


      The House panel unanimously recommended Paxton’s impeachment last week, and on Saturday the full House voted to impeach the attorney general – setting up a Senate trial later this year to determine his fate. 
  

      Under state law, Paxton is now temporarily suspended from his duties as attorney general.
  

      One of the impeachment articles accuses Paxton of using employees of the attorney general’s office to write a legal opinion intended to help Paul avoid the foreclosure sale of properties owned by Paul and his businesses.
  

      It was among a series of articles focused on Paxton’s relationship with Paul, including accusations he hired an outside attorney who issued more than 30 grand jury subpoenas while investigating a “baseless complaint” made by Paul, benefited from Paul hiring a woman with whom Paxton “was having an extramarital affair,” and provided Paul with favorable legal help in exchange for renovations on Paxton’s home.
  

      The articles of impeachment also detail what are described as Paxton’s efforts to cause “protracted” delays in the securities fraud investigation. And the articles say voters in November did not have a full understanding of Paxton’s legal troubles because he had intentionally obscured the details of the charges he faces.

         — 
    


      Allies of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have formed a super PAC to support an expected Republican presidential bid.
  

      The outside group, Tell It Like It Is, has launched a website boosting Christie’s candidacy and encouraging his presence on the GOP debate stage, saying it would “ensure our party engages in the robust, direct, truth-telling conversation we need to start winning again.”
  

      The website lists Republican National Committee member Bill Palatucci, former US Sen. Jeff Chiesa and former US Rep. Susan Brooks as members of the group’s leadership team.
  

      According to a source tied to the newly formed super PAC, any eventual campaign is expected to include people Christie has worked with before, including Mike DuHaime, who has served as a top political strategist to the former governor, and Maria Comella, Christie’s chief messaging officer during his presidential bid.
  

      Details of the super PAC were first reported by The New York Times.
  

      The New Jersey Republican sees himself as the only serious GOP candidate willing to take on former President Donald Trump and someone who could appeal to enough independents to beat President Joe Biden in the general election, CNN has previously reported.
  

      “He feels really good, he’s had very good feedback,” one source supportive of a potential Christie bid told CNN, adding, “He feels there’s a lane that’s dissatisfied with the way Donald Trump conducts himself.”
  

      “I don’t know what would keep him from getting in this race,” the source added. 
  

      Over previous weeks, a source familiar with the conversations told CNN the governor had been “talking to stakeholders and people that matter to him” about whether to run for president. 
  

      “Whether that’s in New Hampshire or elsewhere, he’s been really focused on making the right choice here,” the source continued. 
  

      Others are already looking ahead, including former White House communications director and founder of SkyBridge Capital Anthony Scaramucci.
  

      “If (Christie) announces, I will be there to support him,” Scaramucci told CNN.
  

      Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Christie announced his candidacy on June 30, 2015, in front of supporters in Livingston, New Jersey. This time around, while Christie has not formally announced his candidacy for president, he has publicly explored the possibility of doing so. 
  

      At a late April town hall in New Hampshire, Christie told the crowd, “We have this really unusual situation of not having an incumbent, but having an incumbent,” speaking of Trump. 
  

      “He’s the best-known person in this race,” said Christie, but “one of the reasons I think he can’t come back is he failed us.”
  

      “I’m not gonna stand around and let this happen,” Christie said. “If I decide to run, I’ll be able to try to do something directly about it.” 
  

      Bill Greiner, a New Hampshire businessman and Christie supporter, told CNN a key ingredient to victory against Trump is getting him on the debate stage.
  

      “Everybody wants to knock that person (Trump) off, they want to be that person, (but) if you don’t have a debate, that’s not gonna happen,” Greiner continued.
  

      Christie is one of several high-profile figures mulling a bid for the Republican ticket. Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and talk radio host Larry Elder have officially announced their candidacies.
  

      While Christie called a potential presidential run a “huge risk” at an event hosted by Semafor in Washington last month, he said, “If it turns out that I’m on a debate stage in August of this year and Donald Trump decides to be on it, you can be sure that we’ll have some exchanges that I hope will be illuminating to the public about both him and me.”

President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy convinced themselves of a compromise deal to slow federal spending and replenish the near-empty treasury with borrowed cash.
  

      Now they have the even harder task of trying to convince everyone else to swallow what one Republican, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, described as a “turd sandwich.” 
  

      Frustrated hardline Republican spending hawks like Roy believe McCarthy secretly agreed to give them the power to stop any legislation they don’t like from getting a vote on the House floor. McCarthy’s allies have a different recollection.
  

      The hardliners spent Memorial Day picking apart the 99-page text of the debt ceiling bill line by line and openly wondering how McCarthy could not get more concessions and cuts than two years of caps on non-defense discretionary spending in exchange for taking the debt ceiling off the negotiating table for two years.
  

Read: Debt limit bill text


      And the concerns extend to the opposite end of the political spectrum, with liberal House Democrats frustrated with Biden’s dealmaking. But the same arguments Biden could use to mollify progressives will turn off Republicans – underscoring the challenges that Washington’s top negotiators face in selling this compromise to their respective parties’ far-left and far-right flanks.
  

    First test on Tuesday


      The bill faces a gauntlet of votes starting Tuesday, when it goes before the powerful House Rules Committee. If it can avoid roadblocks, the bill could get a final vote in the House Thursday. It could then proceed to the Senate, where it would face a new set of opponents.
  

      Roy is one of three hardline Republicans that McCarthy allowed to sit on the committee, which controls what legislation makes it to the House floor. The panel usually serves as a rubber stamp for the speaker. Not anymore. McCarthy made that concession of giving power to the hardliners – Roy along with Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina – back in January when he was trying to secure support to become speaker. 
  

      Roy and Norman, both members of the House Freedom Caucus, have both publicly dismissed the debt deal, but Massie has not offered a public opinion.
  

    What power did McCarthy give the Freedom Caucus?


      A separate complication is that Roy believes McCarthy also agreed back in January to a handshake deal that the three hardliners could block anything they don’t like from advancing to the full House and that any one of them could scuttle a rule. 
  

      “A reminder that during Speaker negotiations to build the coalition that it was explicit both that nothing would pass Rules Committee without AT LEAST 7 GOP votes - AND that the Committee would not allow reporting out rules without unanimous Republican votes,” Roy tweeted.

Republican tries to scuttle debt limit bill in House Rules Committee as pressure grows on key swing vote




      The second part of Roy’s assertion – that any single Republican could block legislation in the Rules Committee – came as a surprise to some Republicans and was denied by senior GOP sources, according to CNN’s Capitol Hill team.
  

      If McCarthy’s allies on the panel violate the terms of his perceived agreement with the hardliners and send the debt bill to the full house, it could potentially incite a revolt among Freedom Caucus members and jeopardize his tenuous hold on the speaker’s gavel. (Remember another concession McCarthy made to secure the gavel in January – any single member could bring a vote to oust the speaker.) Much depends on whether Massie will support the debt deal or join Roy and Norman in trashing it.
  

      Norman told CNN that he would vote against the rule unless major changes are made to the bipartisan deal. The list of six demands he included in a text message over the weekend makes it seem like he will oppose any bill Democrats could support.
  

      “Bottom line, if the debt limit is raised above the 1.5 level, and if the timeline extends to 2025, IF the student loan payout is still intact, if the IRS agent funding is still there, if the provisions in the IRA is still intact, if the work requirement EXCLUDES MEDICAID, I will vote against the rule,” he said over the weekend.

    Biden team: Pay attention to what isn’t being cut, please


      Republicans believe they are pushing toward 150 House GOP votes or more, two sources told CNN on Monday. But the fact that multiple Republicans are likely to oppose any debt deal means it likely cannot pass without help from Democrats. 
  

      White House officials defended the deal in calls with Democrats, encouraging them to focus on what was saved from the chopping block rather than the relatively modest cuts that would be enacted. And they got a positive sign on Monday when the chair of the moderate New Democrat Coalition came out in support of the bill.
  

      But some Democrats were expressing annoyance Sunday that the White House agreed to negotiate with McCarthy using the borrowing limit as leverage.
  

      Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” – before the legislative text was released – Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal said the White House should be worried about progressives ultimately turning against the bill.
  

      The Washington state Democrat and others were angry that while Biden was able to keep a proposal for federal work requirements for people to qualify for Medicaid coverage out of the bill, he did allow for temporary new work requirements for certain people who get food assistance from the government. The bill, however, would also expand exemptions from those requirements for veterans, people who are homeless and former foster youth.
  

      Asked on Monday if he could get progressives on board, Biden said, “I don’t know.”
  

      “I have a good relationship with Jayapal. I haven’t had a chance to speak with her yet,” he added, speaking from the White House before departing for Delaware. 
  

      There’s not much time for debating individual points. For an idea of how short the US government currently is, consider that there are multiple billionaires who currently have more cash than the US Treasury. With payments coming due in early June, the latest projected X date – when the US would not be able to meet all of its obligations – is June 5.

Des Moines, Iowa

         — 
    


Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he plans to “counterpunch” against former President Donald Trump’s attacks after kicking off his 2024 campaign in Iowa on Tuesday.
  

      The Florida governor implicitly poked fun at his top rival at his first official campaign event. But speaking to reporters after the event, he had plenty to say about Trump, unloading a series of blows designed to depict him as selfish, unprincipled and petty. 
  

      “I think our voters are looking at this and they say, yeah we appreciate what he did, but we also recognize there are a lot of voters that just aren’t gonna ever vote for him,” DeSantis told reporters. “I know people in Florida who voted against me in ’18 and for me in ‘22. They said in ‘18, ‘I thought you were too much like him and in ‘22 we realized you were your own guy, we’re gonna do it.’”
  

      DeSantis said he thinks Trump’s constant attacks on him would ultimately backfire.
  

      “I can count the number of Republicans in this country on my hand that would rather have lived in New York under (Democratic Gov. Andrew) Cuomo than lived in Florida in our freedom zone,” DeSantis said, alluding to Trump’s recent suggestions that Florida fared worse than New York under Cuomo during the Covid-19 pandemic. “If we just decided the caucuses on that, I would be happy with that verdict by Iowa voters.” 
  

      As the opening contest in the GOP nominating fight, Iowa holds a unique role in sizing up the presidential field, even if it has not proven to be predictive of the eventual nominee. But with a former president seeking a return to the White House for the first time in a century, the Hawkeye State will be closely watched for any sign that Trump’s hold on Republican voters is slipping.
  

      During his scripted remarks, DeSantis offered familiar culprits for the societal ills he has railed against as governor – wokeism, leftism and diversity initiatives – while painting a dark picture of the country that he said is “going in the wrong direction” and “infected” by “leftism.”
  

      “We can’t have every major institution going on ideological joy rides,” he said. “We have to be guided by reality. Merit must trump identity politics. No American should have to compete in the woke Olympics just to get a job or to get into school.”
  

      He vowed to exorcize the country of these so-called ideological agendas, while promising unspecified accountability for the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, to reign in federal bureaucracies and to finish the border wall that Trump started.
  

      “If I’m president, this will finally be the time where we bring this issue to a conclusion. We will reestablish the sovereignty of this nation,” DeSantis said.
  

      After technical difficulties overshadowed the pronouncement of his presidential aspirations on Twitter last week, DeSantis’ first official stop as a candidate carried the more familiar hallmarks of a campaign launch. He spoke at an evangelical church just outside Des Moines – a venue that is illustrative of how faith remains an influential force for Republicans, particularly in Iowa, as they choose their nominee – and is embarking on a traditional three-day swing through key early nominating states.
  

      DeSantis has spent much of the days since his announcement explaining his unconventional launch and sharpening his criticism of Trump after largely avoiding discussing the former president this spring. He has targeted Trump’s stewardship of the economy and the pandemic and accused him of being soft on crime and ineffective.
  

      Although he didn’t mention Trump by name during his official remarks, he said it will take two terms to accomplish his list of priorities – a nod to the fact Trump, as a former president, is restricted to one term – and suggested, as he has for weeks, that the GOP needs to turn the page on “the culture of losing” in recent elections.
  

      “It’s time we impose our will on Washington, DC,” DeSantis said. “You can’t do any of this if you don’t win.”
  

      Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, accused DeSantis of plagiarizing him with the Florida governor’s campaign slogan, “Great American comeback.”
  

      “Perhaps, the DeSantis communications staff was preoccupied attempting to extinguish the flames of their candidate’s announcement to come up with their own message,” Trump’s campaign said.  
  

      Though he told Fox News over Memorial Day weekend that he intends to “compete everywhere,” DeSantis said that he expects Iowa will present a unique opportunity to contrast the “values” between him and Trump. He said his policy wins on conservative priorities – which includes a six-week abortion ban and new restrictions on teaching about race or LGBTQ topics – compares favorably with recent Republican victories in Iowa.
  

      “Iowa’s very important,” DeSantis said on Fox News. “We obviously have a lot in common with Iowa in terms of what Florida has done and what they’ve done under Governor Kim Reynolds. And I think the groundswell of support has been really, really strong. We’re going to press the case.”
  

      Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis, has spent weeks building out an operation in the state, hiring staff and enlisting support from dozens of lawmakers. Leading that effort is veteran GOP operative Jeff Roe, the architect of Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2016 campaign. Cruz won the Iowa caucuses that year, triumphing over several candidates including Trump.
  

      Though polls continue to show DeSantis is Trump’s top rival for the nomination, he is jumping into an increasingly crowded field and his early movements suggest his political team is preparing for a protracted fight. Following a swing through Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, DeSantis will return to Iowa on Saturday for Sen. Joni Ernst’s Roast and Ride event.
  

      The event has become a key stop for presidential candidates – nearly all of the announced and expected field, save for Trump, has committed – and DeSantis’ willingness to participate in a traditional GOP cattle call is the clearest example yet he will have to grind through the race like the rest of the field.
  

      Trump is also bracing for a difficult road to the nomination. Though Iowa was hardly a competitive battleground in the midterms, he held a pre-election rally in the state last November. He is scheduled to participate in a town hall with Fox News on Thursday in Clive, Iowa.
  

      DeSantis’ event Tuesday was in that same Des Moines suburb. Ahead of the event at the evangelical church, he and his wife, Casey, were expected to meet with 15 local Iowa pastors, according to a DeSantis campaign source familiar with the plans.
  

      The pastors would be “praying over the family and the governor’s candidacy,” the source said.
  

      DeSantis has sought to make inroads in evangelical circles in the weeks leading up to his campaign launch. He and his wife dined with Bob Vander Plaats, president of Iowa-based The Family Leader, at the Florida Governor’s Mansion earlier this month. He addressed students at Liberty University, the Virginia college started by televangelist Jerry Falwell, in April and recently joined evangelical commentator Franklin Graham for an on-stage chat at the annual meeting of the National Religious Broadcasters association.
  

      Trump, meanwhile, has clashed with the evangelical community of late, accusing church leaders of “disloyalty” for not enthusiastically backing his campaign. Trump has also angered the religious right for declining to say if he would support a federal abortion ban.
  

      “Nobody has ever done more for Right to Life than Donald Trump. I put three Supreme Court justices, who all voted, and (evangelicals) got something that they’ve been fighting for 64 years, for many, many years,’” Trump said in January, referring to the Supreme Court’s overturning of federal abortion rights in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision last summer.
  

      As DeSantis entered the race, Vander Plaats, an influential voice in Iowa politics who has grown increasingly critical of the former president, wrote on Twitter that Trump is leading in the Hawkeye State but has a “self-inflicted” ceiling.
  

      “DeSantis is current favorite for alternative to Trump but needs to clear or diminish the field,” Vander Plaats tweeted last week. “All others need to prove why they’re the better alternative.”
  

      DeSantis was introduced on Tuesday by Reynolds, who said the Florida governor’s record compared well to how Republicans have led in her state. Reynolds is not endorsing in the race but has appeared at most DeSantis events in Iowa this year. 
  

      “Politicians, we tend to talk a lot. But only a few actually get things done,” she said. “Only a few have the resolve and the willingness to stand strong for us. And that’s who Ron is at his core.”

      Dozens of NATO peacekeepers were injured after they were attacked by ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo, during protests over the installation of ethnically Albanian mayors.
  

      Violence broke out after Serbian demonstrators tried to block the newly elected mayors from taking office in the northern town of Zvecan on Monday, following a disputed election in April.
  

      While this sort of violence against peacekeepers is rare, tensions have spiked in the region in recent months, fueled by deep historical rifts.
  

      Here’s what you need to know.
  

    What’s the background?


      Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, following the 1998-99 war in which Kosovar Albanians attempted to break from what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, made up of today’s Serbia and Montenegro. NATO intervened in the war to protect Kosovo’s Albanian majority.
  

      Serbia views Kosovo as a breakaway state and does not recognize its independence. Kosovo’s Serbs view themselves as part of Serbia, and see Belgrade as their capital, rather than Pristina.
  






Attempts to ""normalize relations"" between the two countries have mostly been abortive.

      The majority of Kosovo’s Serbs – less than a tenth of the overall population – live in the northern regions, and have increasingly demanded greater autonomy from the ethnic Albanian majority.
  

      The EU-brokered 2013 Brussels Agreement attempted to normalize relations between the two countries. Under this deal, Serbia could create autonomous municipalities in the northern region, but these would have to operate under the Kosovar legal system, with Kosovar police remaining the only police force.
  

      More than a decade on, these municipalities have not been created, leaving disputes over the degree of autonomy for Kosovo’s Serbs to fester.
  

      Even seemingly small details can cause huge flare-ups. For years, Kosovo has wanted Serbs to switch their Serbian car license plates to ones issued by Pristina. Last year, Kosovo’s government announced a two-month window in which plates had to be changed – but pushed the date back after protests.
  

      Ethnic Serb mayors in northern municipalities, along with local judges and some 600 police officers, resigned in November in protest against the looming switch, according to Reuters.
  

    What caused the fresh violence?


      In March, the two countries signed a fresh deal in Ohrin, North Macedonia, aiming again to normalize ties. But this was followed by controversial local elections in four municipalities of northern Kosovo.
  

      Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic called on ethnic Serbs in the region to boycott the elections, saying that they should no longer tolerate a foreign “occupation.”
  

      Serbian List, the main political party in the region, called on the Serb community not to vote in the elections and on its candidates not to stand – leaving ethnically Albanian candidates to run unchallenged.

      Fearing potential violence, Kosovo’s central election commission changed plans to put voting booths in local schools, instead setting up mobile huts patrolled by NATO peacekeepers. 
  

      Kosovo’s Prime Minister Albin Kurti said there had been a “threatening campaign orchestrated by Belgrade and executed through intimidation, pressure and blackmail by criminal groups.”
  

      After polls closed, election officials said only around 1,567 had voted across the four municipalities – a turnout of 3.5%, according to local media.
  

      The diminished turnout was a mark of the boycott’s success in these majority Serb regions. The Zvecan municipality has a population of around 16,800. Of these, more than 16,000 are ethnic Serbs – with only around 500 ethnic Albanians.
  

      The newly-elected Albanian mayor in Zvecan won with scarcely over 100 votes, prompting cries that his authority is illegitimate. 
  

    What happened Monday?


      Ethnic Serb protesters threw Molotov cocktails at NATO’s Kosovo Force (KFOR) troops and used batons to beat their riot shields, as the peacekeepers defended the municipal office in Zvecan. 
  

      KFOR said 30 of its peacekeepers – mostly from its Italian and Hungarian contingents – were wounded.

      The soldiers suffered from “fractures and burns from improvised explosive incendiary devices,” while three soldiers were “wounded by the use of firearms,” according to KFOR.
  

      The peacekeeping mission said that it had increased its presence in northern Kosovo after the newly elected ethnically Albanian mayors took office in majority Kosovo Serb areas. Its aim was to “reduce the risk of escalation,” KFOR said, but troops were “subsequently attacked by increasingly aggressive crowds.”
  

      Kurti condemned the “outrageous attacks” on the peacekeepers. “In a democracy there is no place for fascist violence – not appeal from ballot to bullet,” he tweeted Monday.
  

      In a statement, Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said the situation in northern Kosovo has “never been more difficult.”
  

    What has the reaction been?


      European leaders were quick to condemn the violence. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said he has had contact with both Kurti and Vučić and asked “both parties to urgently take measures to de-escalate tensions immediately and unconditionally.”
  

      Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Tuesday, Borrell said that the EU “condemns in the strongest terms the violence in the north of Kosovo that we have seen in the last few days.”

      France’s foreign ministry issued a statement claiming “It is more essential than ever for Pristina and for Belgrade to show responsibility by returning to the negotiating table with an attitude of compromise in the service of peace and the prosperity of the Serbian and Kosovar citizens.”
  

      While European leaders attempt to strike a careful balance between the two countries, other countries have come to Serbia’s defense.
  

      China’s ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson Mao Ning said Tuesday: “We support Serbia’s effort to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity,” and called on Pristina to establish Serb majority municipalities.

    What happens next?


      NATO is deploying additional forces to Kosovo following Monday’s clashes, according to a statement on Tuesday.
  

      Kosovo’s Prime Minister Kurti told CNN on Tuesday that he would not surrender the country to what he described as “fascist militia.” 
  

      When asked by CNN if his government planned to heed calls to withdraw Kosovar police officers from the country’s northern municipalities as tensions rise, Kurti said: “As long as there is a violent mob outside of the building, I cannot have only few policemen. I need to have police who will defend [the] rule of law, who will keep the order, peace and security, and municipality should be for everyone.”
  

      The violence in Kosovo comes at a precarious political moment in Belgrade. Serbia was rocked earlier this month after two mass shootings killed dozens of people, mostly children.
  

      But what started as candlelit vigils for those killed swelled into fully fledged protests against Vucic’s government and the “culture of violence” over which it has prevailed.
  

      “I never, ever saw (Vucic) so nervous,” said Bosko Jaksic, a foreign policy commentator in Belgrade. “His crisis management is not functioning.”
  

      However, the crisis in Kosovo may provide Vucic, who has often used Serbian nationalism as a rallying cry for his supporters, with some welcome relief. 
  

      While the streets of Belgrade have recently been flooded with those protesting Serbia’s “culture of violence,” nationalist demonstrators took to the streets on Tuesday to protest outside the French and German embassies, as Vucic’s supporters turned their anger towards the European promoters of Kosovo’s independence.
  

      In comments on Tuesday, Vucic stoked fears that the violence in Kosovo may pose a threat to ethnic Serbs in the region, saying Serbia has “concern for the survival and security of Serbs in Kosovo.”
  

      “Kosovo is helping him,” said Jakšić. “He’s building his patriotic stature on Kosovo. He’s a big defender of the Serbian cause. He’s the savior of the Serbian people… All that rhetoric that we’ve heard a number of times before is being used again. And there are a lot of people who are buying it.”

      Florida officials changed state campaign finance guidelines in a way that could allow allies of Gov. Ron DeSantis to move tens of millions of dollars to a super PAC supporting his 2024 presidential campaign, state records show. 
  

      The change – made to the Florida Political Committee handbook, which is issued by the Florida Department of State – is significant as it covers the specific kind of transfer of funds that DeSantis allies have planned to support his presidential campaign. The planned move has already drawn a watchdog complaint with the Federal Election Commission.
  

      The updated version of the handbook was published in March of 2023 – months before DeSantis launched his presidential campaign – and was first reported by NBC News. 
  

      In an appendix covering frequently asked questions, the handbook advises Florida committees on whether they can make contributions to out-of-state political entities, including a federal candidate or political action committee.  
  

      Versions of the handbook dating back to 2016 read, “No. A Florida political committee must use its funds solely for Florida political activities.” The version for the 2024 cycle, however, advises, “A Florida political committee may make contributions to an out-of-state political entity that engages solely in non-coordinated expenditures.”
  

      CNN has reached out to the Florida Department of State and the DeSantis campaign for comment.
  

      As governor, DeSantis accumulated more than $80 million through a state political committee that his allies intend to transfer to Never Back Down, a super PAC backing his 2024 presidential bid and the type of group that expressly engages in non-coordinated expenditures.  
  

      The funds, and the transfer, have been the subject of scrutiny as federal campaign finance law is unclear on the matter. The Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, filed a complaint with the FEC about the transfer on Tuesday, but timely resolution of the case is unlikely.
  

      The group’s complaint alleges that DeSantis’ allies “violated federal campaign finance laws by directing or transferring over $80 million to Never Back Down.” 
  

      DeSantis raised the tens of millions of dollars through the state political committee, but that money can’t go directly to his presidential campaign account. As a workaround, the DeSantis allies are aiming to transfer that money to the federal super PAC, which is currently spending millions supporting his White House bid.   
  

      In recent weeks, DeSantis has disassociated from his state committee – his chairperson stepped down and a new chairperson, state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a DeSantis ally, now has stewardship over the leftover funds. The committee, formerly called Friends of Ron DeSantis, changed its name to the Empower Parents PAC. And its website says the reformed political committee “supports the national advancement of issues and candidates committed to protecting parental rights in education.”  
  

      It’s unclear that the FEC can – or would – step in. A similar case arose during the 2020 election, concerning the management of funds by GOP Rep. Byron Donalds. The FEC took no enforcement action in that case.  
  

      Never Back Down also does not yet appear to have received the transfer of funds from DeSantis’ Florida committee, though the group has yet to file a full report detailing its finances with the FEC.  
  

      Further hampering the likelihood of enforcement action, the six commissioners currently leading the FEC have repeatedly deadlocked, 3-3, on several high-profile cases that have appeared before the commission.     
  

      CNN has reached out to the Campaign Legal Center, Never Back Down and the Empower Parents PAC for comment.

         — 
    


      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy helped secure a debt limit deal – now he has to secure its passage in the House, with little room for error and a looming threat to his speakership.
  

      In a win for McCarthy, the bill cleared a key hurdle Tuesday evening when the powerful House Rules Committee voted 7-6 to advance the debt ceiling bill to the floor. The bill will come to floor Wednesday for debate and a final passage vote before it goes to the Senate.
  

      The Rules Committee vote had been highly anticipated due to the fact that some of the loudest conservative critics of the bill are members of the panel. 
  

      The timeframe to get the bill passed through both chambers of Congress and signed into law is extremely tight. Lawmakers are racing the clock to avert a catastrophic default ahead of June 5, the day the Treasury Department has said it will no longer be able to pay all of the nation’s obligations in full and on time. 
  




      In another positive sign for the bill’s prospects in the House, a wide range of members on both sides of the aisle – many of them moderates – appear poised to coalesce behind the deal to avert default. Republicans believe they are pushing toward 150 Republican votes or more, two sources told CNN.
  

      That’s more than a majority of the Republican conference, which McCarthy has been promising for days he could get on the bill.  
  

      “If you think I failed you, I’m sorry. But if you think I failed, I think you’re wrong,” McCarthy told GOP members of the debt limit deal Tuesday night behind closed doors.
  

    Key hurdle to clear  


      To win the speakership, McCarthy agreed to name three conservative hardliners – – GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina – to the Rules committee, a major concession since usually the panel is stacked with close allies of the leadership. 
  

      Roy and Norman have both emerged as leading critics of the bipartisan debt limit bill.
  

      In the lead up to the rule vote, pressure grew on Massie as it was unclear how he would vote. If he did not support the rule, the debt limit bill may have been unable to advance to the House floor.
  

      But when the committee met to consider the bill, Massie said he anticipated he would support the rule.
  

      “I want to see the rule (first) – it’s not printed yet, it’s not been read, but I anticipate voting for this rule,” Massie said.
  

      In January, Massie told CNN he was reluctant to vote against rules to stop bills in their tracks.
  

      “I would be reluctant to try to use the Rules Committee to achieve a legislative outcome, particularly if it doesn’t represent a large majority of our caucus,” Massie said at the time. “So I don’t ever intend to use my position on there to like, hold somebody hostage – or hold legislation hostage.”
  

      Another key concession McCarthy made to win the speakership that looms over the effort to push the debt limit deal: Any member of the House can move to force a vote to topple the speaker known as a motion to vacate.
  

      Roy made the strongest threat yet to McCarthy’s gavel during an interview with Glenn Beck, saying that if the deal can’t be killed in rules or on the floor: “Then we’re going to have to then regroup and figure out the whole leadership arrangement again.”
  

      The comments were confirmed to CNN though his spokesperson.
  






      Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Tuesday that he’s not worried about McCarthy’s speakership. “I think he is doing a good job,” he said. 
  

      Rep. Patrick McHenry said Tuesday he was not worried about McCarthy losing his speakership and defended the deal he helped cut. 
  

      “With a narrow majority in the House, we have the most conservative outcome we possibly could,” McHenry said. 
  

      “I’m proud of the package. I wanted more. I absolutely wanted more, (but) what we have here is better than what was about to come.”
  

      Asked if the speaker’s job is now in jeopardy, McHenry said, “No.”
  

    $1.5 trillion reduction in budget deficits


      The bill would reduce budget deficits by $1.5 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the package, released Tuesday evening. By contrast, the debt limit legislation passed by House Republicans in late April would have cut deficits by $4.8 trillion, according to the agency.
  

      Under the deal negotiated with the White House, discretionary spending would decrease by $1.3 trillion over the decade, while mandatory spending would be cut by $10 billion and revenues would decrease by $2 billion, on net.
  

      The CBO’s score also contains one potential complication for McCarthy. The work requirements provisions in the package would boost enrollment in the food stamps program by 78,000 people in an average month when fully implemented, as well as increase spending by $2.1 billion over the decade.
  

      The legislation calls for increasing the upper age limit of adults subject to the existing work requirement to age 55, up from the current age 50. But veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster youth of all ages would be exempt.
  

      Changes to the work requirement provisions in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program would reduce spending by $5 million over the decade.
  

      House Republicans were adamant about increasing work requirements in safety net programs, which they said would lead to less dependency on government aid.
  

      The package would also rescind $1.4 billion in funding for the Internal Revenue Service, but this would decrease revenues by $2.3 billion over the decade, resulting in a net increase in the deficit of $900 million, over the period, the CBO said. The agency anticipates that cutting that funding would result in fewer enforcement actions and a reduction in revenue collections.
  

      As part of the deal with the White House, some $20 billion of the $80 billion funding boost the IRS is receiving over the next decade from the Inflation Reduction Act would be diverted to partially make up for reductions in other discretionary spending.

    1. Debt limit


      President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy forged a debt ceiling deal to possibly avoid a catastrophic US default in a matter of days, but not everyone is happy about it. The agreement would suspend the nation’s $31.4 trillion debt limit through January 1, 2025, removing it as a potential issue in the 2024 presidential election. Under the deal, non-defense spending would remain relatively flat in fiscal 2024 and increase by 1% in fiscal 2025. (You can read the whole text here.) Some Republican reps argue it does little to rein in government spending, while some Dems have criticized the inclusion of things like temporarily expanded work requirements for some food stamp recipients. Despite tension in the House, the agreement has sparked optimism in global markets and among some of the US’ leading business groups. It’s not a done deal, though. Once – and if – the measure passes the House, it’s on to the Senate. The estimated deadline for a possible default is June 5.  
  

    2. Turkey


      Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won a historic third term, extending his 20 years at the top of Turkey’s political landscape. Erdogan defeated challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu in Sunday’s runoff election after failing to win an outright majority in the first round of votes in mid-May. Some chief concerns among Turkish voters were high inflation and a cost of living crisis, situations blamed largely on the president’s unorthodox economic policies. Also on their minds was the government’s handling of the earthquake in February that left more than 50,000 people dead. Some of Erdogan’s supporters say his win is a victory for the Muslim world. Opponents say his control over state resources and affiliation with the country’s media helped sway the vote in his favor.

    3. Ukraine


      Russia’s Defense Ministry has blamed Ukraine for an alleged drone attack on Moscow today that damaged buildings and injured two people. Ukraine has increased the number of strikes on Russian ammunition depots, logistical nodes and rear echelon bases in the last few days as Ukrainian forces gear up for a long-anticipated counteroffensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the timing of the counteroffensive has been set, but he did not provide specific details. Ukrainian cities continue to experience barrage after barrage of Russian missile and drone strikes, but the country’s forces have appeared unfazed as counteroffensive training and planning continues.

      A 16-year-old girl was stabbed and bludgeoned to death in a busy public alleyway in Delhi on Sunday, sparking renewed outrage over the country’s ongoing struggles with violence against women and girls. Video of the incident in the capital city showed multiple people walking close by as the attack went on. The incident is the latest in a long line of killings and rapes that have triggered anger about whether enough is being done to protect women in India and punish attackers. India has long struggled to address gender violence. In 2018, a survey of experts on women’s issues ranked the country as the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman. Reports in recent years seem to show a continued increase in the frequency of such crimes. 
  

    5. Uganda


      Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni has signed a series of anti-LGBTQ laws that are being characterized as among the harshest in the world. The bill criminalizes sex education for the gay community and makes it illegal to prevent exposure of what it calls perpetrators of “aggravated homosexuality” to the police. It also calls for “rehabilitation”– widely discredited conversion therapy – for gay offenders. Activists in the country say they fear the laws will embolden citizens to act extrajudicially against the LGBTQ community. Civil society groups are already looking to challenge the measures, and they could find a way as a similarly homophobic law was struck down by Ugandan courts in 2014. Western governments are already criticizing the law. President Biden described the bill in a statement as “a tragic violation of universal human rights.”

“The amount of backlash that I have gotten has been overwhelming. I just hope that this is the beginning of the end of the messages and the onslaught that I’m getting.”
